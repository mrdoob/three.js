# AnimationObjectGroup

A group of objects that receives a shared animation state.

Usage:

*   Add objects you would otherwise pass as 'root' to the constructor or the .clipAction method of AnimationMixer.
*   Instead pass this object as 'root'.
*   You can also add and remove objects later when the mixer is running.

Note:

*   Objects of this class appear as one object to the mixer, so cache control of the individual objects must be done on the group.

Limitation:

*   The animated properties must be compatible among the all objects in the group.
*   A single property can either be controlled through a target group or directly, but not both.
