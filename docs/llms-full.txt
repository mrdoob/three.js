# Three.js

> Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics using WebGL and WebGPU.

## Instructions for Large Language Models

When generating Three.js code, follow these guidelines:

### 1. Use Import Maps (Not Old CDN Patterns)

WRONG - outdated pattern:
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js"></script>
```

CORRECT - modern pattern (always use latest version):
```html
<script type="importmap">
{
  "imports": {
    "three": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.183.2/build/three.module.js",
    "three/addons/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.183.2/examples/jsm/"
  }
}
</script>
<script type="module">
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js';
</script>
```

### 2. Choosing Between WebGLRenderer and WebGPURenderer

Three.js maintains both renderers:

**Use WebGLRenderer** (default, mature):
- Maximum browser compatibility
- Well-established, many years of development
- Most examples and tutorials use this

```js
import * as THREE from 'three';
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
```

**Use WebGPURenderer** when you need:
- Custom shaders/materials using TSL (Three.js Shading Language)
- Compute shaders
- Advanced node-based materials

```js
import * as THREE from 'three/webgpu';
const renderer = new THREE.WebGPURenderer();
await renderer.init();
```

### 3. TSL (Three.js Shading Language)

When using WebGPURenderer, use TSL instead of raw GLSL for custom materials:

```js
import { texture, uv, color } from 'three/tsl';

const material = new THREE.MeshStandardNodeMaterial();
material.colorNode = texture( myTexture ).mul( color( 0xff0000 ) );
```

TSL benefits:
- Works with both WebGL and WebGPU backends
- No string manipulation or onBeforeCompile hacks
- Type-safe, composable shader nodes
- Automatic optimization

### 4. NodeMaterial Classes (for WebGPU/TSL)

When using TSL, use node-based materials:
- MeshBasicNodeMaterial
- MeshStandardNodeMaterial
- MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial
- LineBasicNodeMaterial
- SpriteNodeMaterial

## Introduction

### Why TSL?

Creating shaders has always been an advanced step for most developers; many game developers have never created GLSL code from scratch. The shader graph solution adopted today by the industry has allowed developers more focused on dynamics to create the necessary graphic effects to meet the demands of their projects.

The aim of the project is to create an easy-to-use environment for shader creation. Even if for this we need to create complexity behind it, this happened initially with `Renderer` and now with the `TSL`.

Other benefits that TSL brings besides simplifying shading creation are keeping the `renderer agnostic`, while all the complexity of a material can be imported into different modules and use `tree shaking` without breaking during the process.

### Example

A `detail map` makes things look more real in games. It adds tiny details like cracks or bumps to surfaces. In this example we will scale uv to improve details when seen up close and multiply with a base texture.

#### Old

This is how we would achieve that using `.onBeforeCompile()`:

```js
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial();
material.map = colorMap;
material.onBeforeCompile = ( shader ) => {

	shader.uniforms.detailMap = { value: detailMap };

	let token = '#define STANDARD';

	let insert = /* glsl */`
		uniform sampler2D detailMap;
	`;

	shader.fragmentShader = shader.fragmentShader.replace( token, token + insert );

	token = '#include <map_fragment>';

	insert = /* glsl */`
		diffuseColor *= texture2D( detailMap, vMapUv * 10.0 );
	`;

	shader.fragmentShader = shader.fragmentShader.replace( token, token + insert );

};
```

Any simple change from this makes the code increasingly complicated using `.onBeforeCompile`, the result we have today in the community are countless types of parametric materials that do not communicate with each other, and that need to be updated periodically to be operating, limiting the creativity to create unique materials reusing modules in a simple way.

#### New

With `TSL` the code would look like this:

```js
import { texture, uv } from 'three/tsl';

const detail = texture( detailMap, uv().mul( 10 ) );

const material = new THREE.MeshStandardNodeMaterial();
material.colorNode = texture( colorMap ).mul( detail );
```

`TSL` is also capable of encoding code into different outputs such as `WGSL`/`GLSL` - `WebGPU`/`WebGL`, in addition to optimizing the shader graph automatically and through codes that can be inserted within each `Node`. This allows the developer to focus on productivity and leave the graphical management part to the `Node System`.

Another important feature of a graph shader is that we will no longer need to care about the sequence in which components are created, because the `Node System` will only declare and include it once.

Let's say that you import `positionWorld` into your code, even if another component uses it, the calculations performed to obtain `position world` will only be performed once, as is the case with any other node such as: `normalWorld`, `modelPosition`, etc.

### Architecture

All `TSL` components are extended from `Node` class. The `Node` allows it to communicate with any other, value conversions can be automatic or manual, a `Node` can receive the output value expected by the parent `Node` and modify its own output snippet. It's possible to modulate them using `tree shaking` in the shader construction process, the `Node` will have important information such as `geometry`, `material`, `renderer` as well as the `backend`, which can influence the type and value of output.

The main class responsible for creating the code is `NodeBuilder`. This class can be extended to any output programming language, so you can use TSL for a third language if you wish. Currently `NodeBuilder` has two extended classes, the `WGSLNodeBuilder` aimed at WebGPU and `GLSLNodeBuilder` aimed at WebGL2.

The build process is based on three pillars: `setup`, `analyze` and `generate`.

| | |
| -- | -- |
| `setup` | Use `TSL` to create a completely customized code for the `Node` output. The `Node` can use many others within itself, have countless inputs, but there will always be a single output. |
| `analyze` | This proccess will check the `nodes` that were created in order to create useful information for `generate` the snippet, such as the need to create or not a cache/variable for optimizing a node. |
| `generate` | An output of `string` will be returned from each `node`. Any node will also be able to create code in the flow of shader, supporting multiple lines. |

`Node` also have a native update process invoked by the `update()` function, these events be called by `frame`, `render call` and `object draw`.

It is also possible to serialize or deserialize a `Node` using `serialize()` and `deserialize()` functions.

## Learning TSL

TSL is a Node-based shader abstraction, written in JavaScript. TSL's functions are inspired by GLSL, but follow a very different concept. WGSL and GLSL are focused on creating GPU programs, in TSL this is one of the features.

### Seamless Integration with JavaScript/TypeScript

- Unified Code
  - Write shader logic directly in JS/TS, eliminating the need to manipulate strings.
  - Create and manipulate render objects just like any other JavaScript logic inside a TSL function.
  - Advanced events to control a Node before and after the object is rendered.
- JS Ecosystem
  - Use native **import/export**, **NPM**, and integrate **JS/TS** components directly into your shader logic.
- Typing
  - Benefit from better type checking (especially with **TypeScript** and **[@three-types](https://github.com/three-types/three-ts-types)**), increasing code robustness.

### Shader-Graph Inspired Structure

- Focus on Intent
  - Build materials by connecting nodes through: [positionWorld](#position), [normalWorld](#normal), [screenUV](#screen), [attribute()](#attributes), etc. 
More declarative("what") vs. imperative("how").
- Composition & High-Level Concepts
  - Work with high-level concepts for Node Material like [colorNode](#basic), [roughnessNode](#standard), [metalnessNode](#standard), [positionNode](#basic), etc. This preserves the integrity of the lighting model while allowing customizations, helping to avoid mistakes from incorrect setups.
- Keeping an eye on software exchange
  - Modern 3D authoring software uses Shader-Graph based material composition to exchange between other software. TSL already has its own MaterialX integration.
- Easier Migration
  - Many functions are directly inspired by GLSL to smooth the learning curve for those with prior experience.

### Rendering Manipulation

- Control rendering steps and create new render-passes per individual TSL functions.
  - Implement complex effects is easily with nodes using a single function call either in post-processing and in materials allowing the node itself to manage the rendering process as it needs.
    - `gaussianBlur()`: Double render-pass gaussian blur node. It can be used in the material or in post-processing through a single function.
  - Easy access to renderer buffers using TSL functions like: 
    - `viewportSharedTexture()`: Accesses the beauty what has already been rendered, preserving the render-order.
    - `viewportLinearDepth()`: Accesses the depth what has already been rendered, preserving the render-order.
  - Integrated Compute Shaders
    - Perform calculations on buffers using compute stage directly during an object's rendering.
  - TSL allows dynamic manipulation of renderer functions, which makes it more customizable than intermediate languages ​​that would have to use flags in fixed pipelines for this.
  - You just need to use the events of a Node for the renderer manipulations, without needing to modify the core.

### Automatic Optimization and Workarounds

- Your TSL code automatically benefits from optimizations and workarounds implemented in the Three.js compiler with each new version.
  - Simplifications
    - Automatic type conversions.
    - Execute a block of code in vertex-stage and get it in fragment-stage just using `vertexStage( node )`.
    - Automatically choose interpolation method for varyings depending on type.
    - Don't worry about collisions of global variables internally when using Nodes.
  - Polyfills
    - e.g: `textureSample()` function in the vertex shader (not natively supported in WGSL) is correctly transpiled to work.
    - e.g: Automatic correction for the `pow()` function, which didn't accept negative bases on Windows/DirectX using WGSL.
  - Optimizations
    - Repeated expressions: TSL can automatically create temporary variables to avoid redundant calculations.
    - Automatic reuse of uniforms and attributes.
    - Creating varying only if necessary. Otherwise they are replaced by simple variables.

### Target audience
  - Beginners users
    - You only need one line to create your first custom shader.
  - Advanced users
    - Makes creating shaders simple but not limited. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2gDL9Qk_vo
    - If you don't like fixed pipelines and low level, you'll love this.

### Share everything

#### TSL is based on Nodes, so don’t worry about sharing your **functions** and **uniforms** across materials and post-processing.

```js
// Shared the same uniform with various materials

const sharedColor = uniform( new THREE.Color() );

materialA.colorNode = sharedColor.div( 2 );
materialB.colorNode = sharedColor.mul( .5 );
materialC.colorNode = sharedColor.add( .5 );
```

#### Deferred Function: High level of customization, goodby **#defines**

Access **material**, **geometry**, **object**, **camera**, **scene**, **renderer** and more directly from a TSL function. Function calls are only performed at the time of building the shader allowing you to customize the function according to the object's setup.

```js
// Returns an uniform of the material's custom color if it exists 

const customColor = Fn( ( { material, geometry, object } ) => {

	if ( material.userData.customColor !== undefined ) {

		return uniform( material.userData.customColor );

	}

	return vec3( 0 );

} );

//

material.colorNode = customColor();

```

#### Load a texture-based matrix inside a TSL function

This can be used for any other JS and Three.js ecosystem needs. You can manipulate your assets according to the needs of a function. This can work for creating buffers, attributes, uniforms and any other JavaScript operation.

```js
let bayer16Texture = null;

export const bayer16 = Fn( ( [ uv ] ) => {

	if ( bayer16Texture === null ) {

		const bayer16Base64 = 'data:image/png;base64,...==';

		bayer16Texture = new TextureLoader().load( bayer16Base64 );

	}

	return textureLoad( bayer16Texture, ivec2( uv ).mod( int( 16 ) ) );

} );

//

material.colorNode = bayer16( screenCoordinate );

```

#### The node architecture allows the creation of instances of custom attributes and buffers through simple functions.

```js
// Range values node example

const randomColor = range( new THREE.Color( 0x000000 ), new THREE.Color( 0xFFFFFF ) );

material.colorNode = randomColor;

//...

const mesh = new THREE.InstancedMesh( geometry, material, count );
```

#### TSL loves JavaScript

TSL syntax follows JavaScript style because they are the same thing, so if you come from GLSL you can explore new possibilities.

```js
// A simple example of Function closure

const mainTask = Fn( () => {

	const task2 = Fn( ( [ a, b ] ) => {

		return a.add( b ).mul( 0.5 );

	} );


	return task2( color( 0x00ff00 ), color( 0x0000ff ) );

} );

//

material.colorNode = mainTask();
```

#### Simplification

Double render-pass `gaussianBlur()` node. It can be used in the material or in post-processing through a single function. 

```js
// Applies a double render-pass gaussianBlur and then a grayscale filter before the object with the material is rendered.

const myTexture = texture( map );

material.colorNode = grayscale( gaussianBlur( myTexture, 4 ) );
```

Accesses what has already been rendered, preserving the render-order for easy refraction effects, avoiding multiple render-pass and manual sorts.

```js
// Leaving the back in grayscale.

material.colorNode = grayscale( viewportSharedTexture( screenUV ) );
material.transparent = true;
```

#### Extend the TSL

You no longer need to create a Material for each desired effect, instead create Nodes. A Node can have access to the Material and can be used in many ways. Extend the TSL from Nodes and let the user use it in creative ways.

A great example of this is [TSL-Textures](https://boytchev.github.io/tsl-textures/).

```js
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { simplexNoise } from 'tsl-textures';

material.colorNode = simplexNoise ( {
	scale: 2,
	balance: 0,
	contrast: 0,
	color: new THREE.Color(16777215),
	background: new THREE.Color(0),
	seed: 0
} );

```

## Constants and explicit conversions

Input functions can be used to create contants and do explicit conversions.
> Conversions are also performed automatically if the output and input are of different types.

| Name | Returns a constant or convertion of type: |
| -- | -- |
| `float( node\|number )` | `float` |
| `int( node\|number )` | `int` |
| `uint( node\|number )` | `uint` |
| `bool( node\|value )` | `boolean` |
| `color( node\|hex\|r,g,b )` | `color` |
| `vec2( node\|Vector2\|x,y )` | `vec2` |
| `vec3( node\|Vector3\|x,y,z )` | `vec3` |
| `vec4( node\|Vector4\|x,y,z,w )` | `vec4` |
| `mat2( node\|Matrix2\|a,b,c,d )` | `mat2` |
| `mat3( node\|Matrix3\|a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i )` | `mat3` |
| `mat4( node\|Matrix4\|a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p )` | `mat4` |
| `ivec2( node\|x,y )` | `ivec2` |
| `ivec3( node\|x,y,z )` | `ivec3` |
| `ivec4( node\|x,y,z,w )` | `ivec4` |
| `uvec2( node\|x,y )` | `uvec2` |
| `uvec3( node\|x,y,z )` | `uvec3` |
| `uvec4( node\|x,y,z,w )` | `uvec4` |
| `bvec2( node\|x,y )` | `bvec2` |
| `bvec3( node\|x,y,z )` | `bvec3` |
| `bvec4( node\|x,y,z,w )` | `bvec4` |

Example:

```js
import { color, vec2, positionWorld } from 'three/tsl';

// constant
material.colorNode = color( 0x0066ff );

// conversion
material.colorNode = vec2( positionWorld ); // result positionWorld.xy
```

## Conversions

It is also possible to perform conversions using the `method chaining`:

| Name | Returns a constant or conversion of type: |
| -- | -- |
| `.toFloat()` | `float` |
| `.toInt()` | `int` |
| `.toUint()` | `uint` |
| `.toBool()` | `boolean` |
| `.toColor()` | `color` |
| `.toVec2()` | `vec2` |
| `.toVec3()` | `vec3` |
| `.toVec4()` | `vec4` |
| `.toMat2()` | `mat2` |
| `.toMat3()` | `mat3` |
| `.toMat4()` | `mat4` |
| | |
| `.toIVec2()` | `ivec2` |
| `.toIVec3()` | `ivec3` |
| `.toIVec4()` | `ivec4` |
| `.toUVec2()` | `uvec2` |
| `.toUVec3()` | `uvec3` |
| `.toUVec4()` | `uvec4` |
| `.toBVec2()` | `bvec2` |
| `.toBVec3()` | `bvec3` |
| `.toBVec4()` | `bvec4` |

Example:

```js
import { positionWorld } from 'three/tsl';

// conversion
material.colorNode = positionWorld.toVec2(); // result positionWorld.xy
```

## Uniform

Uniforms are useful to update values of variables like colors, lighting, or transformations without having to recreate the shader program. They are the true variables from a GPU's point of view.

| Name | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `uniform( boolean \| number \| Color \| Vector2 \| Vector3 \| Vector4 \| Matrix3 \| Matrix4, type = null )` | Dynamic values. |

Example:

```js
const myColor = uniform( new THREE.Color( 0x0066FF ) );

material.colorNode = myColor;
```

### `uniform.on*Update()`

It is also possible to create update events on `uniforms`, which can be defined by the user:

| Name | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `.onObjectUpdate( function )` | It will be updated every time an object like `Mesh` is rendered with this `node` in `Material`. |
| `.onRenderUpdate( function )` | It will be updated once per render, common and shared materials, fog, tone mapping, etc. |
| `.onFrameUpdate( function )` | It will be updated only once per frame, recommended for values ​​that will be updated only once per frame, regardless of when `render-pass` the frame has, cases like `time` for example. |

Example:

```js
const posY = uniform( 0 ); // it's possible use uniform( 'float' )

// or using event to be done automatically
// { object } will be the current rendering object
posY.onObjectUpdate( ( { object } ) => object.position.y );

// you can also update manually using the .value property
posY.value = object.position.y;

material.colorNode = posY;
```

## Swizzle

Swizzling is the technique that allows you to access, reorder, or duplicate the components of a vector using a specific notation within TSL. This is done by combining the identifiers:

```js
const original = vec3( 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 ); // (x, y, z)
const swizzled = original.zyx; // swizzled = (3.0, 2.0, 1.0)
```

It's possible use `xyzw`, `rgba` or `stpq`.

## Operators

| Name | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `.add( node \| value, ... )` | Return the addition of two or more value. |
| `.sub( node \| value )` | Return the subraction of two or more value. |
| `.mul( node \| value )` | Return the multiplication of two or more value. |
| `.div( node \| value )` | Return the division of two or more value. |
| `.mod( node \| value )` | Computes the remainder of dividing the first node by the second. |
| `.equal( node \| value )` | Checks if two nodes are equal. |
| `.notEqual( node \| value )` | Checks if two nodes are not equal. |
| `.lessThan( node \| value )` | Checks if the first node is less than the second. |

## Function

### `Fn( function, layout = null )`

It is possible to use classic JS functions or a `Fn()` interface. The main difference is that `Fn()` creates a controllable environment, allowing the use of `stack` where you can use `assign` and `conditional`, while the classic function only allows inline approaches.

Example:

```js
// tsl function
const oscSine = Fn( ( [ t = time ] ) => {

	return t.add( 0.75 ).mul( Math.PI * 2 ).sin().mul( 0.5 ).add( 0.5 );

} );

// inline function
export const oscSine = ( t = time ) => t.add( 0.75 ).mul( Math.PI * 2 ).sin().mul( 0.5 ).add( 0.5 );
```
> Both above can be called with `oscSin( value )`.

TSL allows the entry of parameters as object, this is useful in functions that have many optional arguments.

Example:

```js
const oscSine = Fn( ( { timer = time } ) => {

	return timer.add( 0.75 ).mul( Math.PI * 2 ).sin().mul( 0.5 ).add( 0.5 );

} );

const value = oscSine( { timer: value } );
```

Parameters as object also allows traditional calls as an array, enabling different types of usage.

```js
const col = Fn( ( { r, g, b } ) => {

	return vec3( r, g, b );

} );


// Any of the options below will return a green color.

material.colorNode = col( 0, 1, 0 ); // option 1
material.colorNode = col( { r: 0, g: 1, b: 0 } ); // option 2
```

If you want to use an export function compatible with `tree shaking`, remember to use `/*@__PURE__*/`

```js
export const oscSawtooth = /*@__PURE__*/ Fn( ( [ timer = time ] ) => timer.fract() );
```

The second parameter of the function, if there are any parameters, will always be the first if there are none, and is dedicated to `NodeBuilder`. In `NodeBuilder` you can find out details about the current construction process and also obtain objects related to the shader construction, such as `material`, `geometry`, `object`, `camera`, etc.

[See an example](#deferred-function-high-level-of-customization-goodby-defines)

## Variables

Functions used to declare variables.

| Name | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `.toVar( node, name = null )` or `Var( node, name = null )` | Converts a node into a reusable variable in the shader. |
| `.toConst( node, name = null )` or `Const( node, name = null )` | Converts a node into an inline constant. |
| `property( type, name = null )` | Declares an property but does not assign an initial value. |

The name is optional; if set to `null`, the node system will generate one automatically.  
Creating a variable, constant, or property can help optimize the shader graph manually or assist in debugging.

```js
const uvScaled = uv().mul( 10 ).toVar();

material.colorNode = texture( map, uvScaled );
```

***

## Array

The array() function in TSL allows creating constant or dynamic value arrays; there are many ways to create arrays in TSL.

#### The standard way

```js
const colors = array( [
	vec3( 1, 0, 0 ),
	vec3( 0, 1, 0 ),
	vec3( 0, 0, 1 )
] );

const greenColor = colors.element( 1 );

// greenColor: vec3( 0, 1, 0 )
```

#### Fixed size

```js
const a = array( 'vec3', 2 );

// a: [ vec3( 0, 0, 0 ), vec3( 0, 0, 0 ) ]
```

#### Fill with a default value

```js
const a = vec3( 0, 0, 1 ).toArray( 2 ); 

// a: [ vec3( 0, 0, 1 ), vec3( 0, 0, 1 ) ]
```

#### Define a type explicitly

```js
const a = array( [ 0, 1, 2 ], 'uint' );
const value = a.element( 1 );

// value: 1u
```

### Array Uniform

It is possible to use the same array logic for uniforms using Three.js native components or primitive values.

```js
const tintColors = uniformArray( [
	new Color( 1, 0, 0 ),
	new Color( 0, 1, 0 ),
	new Color( 0, 0, 1 )
], 'color' );

const redColor = tintColors.element( 0 );
```

#### Accessing values

To access the values you can use `a[ 1 ]` or `a.element( 1 )`. The difference is that `a[ 1 ]` only allows constant values, while `a.element( 1 )` allows the use of dynamic values such as `a.element( index )` where index is a node.

### Array Storage

It is possible to create arrays that can be used in compute shaders and storage operations.

| Name | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `instancedArray( array, type )` | Creates an instanced buffer attribute array. |
| `attributeArray( array, type )` | Creates a buffer attribute array. |

## Varying

Functions used to declare varying.

| Name | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `vertexStage( node )` | Computes the node in the vertex stage. |
| `varying( node, name = null )` | Computes the node in the vertex stage and passes interpolated values to the fragment shader. |
| `varyingProperty( type, name = null )` | Declares an varying property but does not assign an initial value. |

Let's suppose you want to optimize some calculation in the `vertex stage` but are using it in a slot like `material.colorNode`.

For example:

```js
// multiplication will be executed in vertex stage
const normalView = vertexStage( modelNormalMatrix.mul( normalLocal ) );

// normalize will be computed in fragment stage while `normalView` is computed on vertex stage
material.colorNode = normalView.normalize();
```

The first parameter of `vertexStage()` `modelNormalMatrix.mul( normalLocal )` will be computed in `vertex stage`, and the return from `vertexStage()` will be a `varying` as we are used in WGSL/GLSL, this can optimize extra calculations in the `fragment stage`. The second parameter of `varying()` allows you to add a custom name in code generation.

If `varying()` is added only to `material.positionNode`, it will only return a simple variable and varying will not be created because `material.positionNode` is one of the only node material input that are computed at the vertex stage.

## Conditional

### If-else

`If-else` conditionals can be used within `Fn()`. Conditionals in `TSL` are built using the `If` function:

```js
If( conditional, function )
.ElseIf( conditional, function )
.Else( function )
```
> Notice here the `i` in `If` is capitalized.

Example:

In this example below, we will limit the y position of the geometry to 10.

```js
const limitPosition = Fn( ( { position } ) => {

	const limit = 10;

	const result = vec3( position );

	If( result.y.greaterThan( limit ), () => {

		result.y = limit;

	} );

	return result;

} );

material.positionNode = limitPosition( { position: positionLocal } );
```

Example using `elseif`:

```js
const limitPosition = Fn( ( { position } ) => {

	const limit = 10;

	const result = vec3( position );

	If( result.y.greaterThan( limit ), () => {

		result.y = limit;

	} ).ElseIf( result.y.lessThan( limit ), () => {

		result.y = limit;

	} );

	return result;

} );

material.positionNode = limitPosition( { position: positionLocal } );
```
### Switch-Case

A Switch-Case statement is an alternative way to express conditional logic compared to If-Else.

```js
const col = color();

Switch( 0 )
	.Case( 0, () => {

		col.assign( color( 1, 0, 0 ) );

	} ).Case( 1, () => {

		col.assign( color( 0, 1, 0 ) );

	} ).Case( 2, 3, () => {

		col.assign( color( 0, 0, 1 ) );

	} ).Default( () => {

		col.assign( color( 1, 1, 1 ) );

	} );
```
Notice that there are some rules when using this syntax which differentiate TSL from JavaScript:

- There is no fallthrough support. So each `Case()` statement has an implicit break.
- A `Case()` statement can hold multiple values (selectors) for testing. 

### Ternary

Different from `if-else`, a ternary conditional will return a value and can be used outside of `Fn()`.

```js
const result = select( value.greaterThan( 1 ), 1.0, value );
```
> Equivalent in JavaScript should be: `value > 1 ? 1.0 : value`

## Loop

This module offers a variety of ways to implement loops in TSL. In it's basic form it's:
```js
Loop( count, ( { i } ) => {

} );
```
However, it is also possible to define a start and end ranges, data types and loop conditions:
```js
Loop( { start: int( 0 ), end: int( 10 ), type: 'int', condition: '<', name: 'i' }, ( { i } ) => {

} );
```
Nested loops can be defined in a compacted form:
```js
Loop( 10, 5, ( { i, j } ) => {

} );
```
Loops that should run backwards can be defined like so:
```js
Loop( { start: 10 }, () => {} );
```
It is possible to execute with boolean values, similar to the `while` syntax.
```js
const value = float( 0 );

Loop( value.lessThan( 10 ), () => {

	value.addAssign( 1 );

} );
```
The module also provides `Break()` and `Continue()` TSL expression for loop control.

## Method chaining

`Method chaining` will only be including operators, converters, math and some core functions. These functions, however, can be used on any `node`.

Example:

`oneMinus()` is a mathematical function like `abs()`, `sin()`. This example uses `.oneMinus()` as a built-in function in the class that returns a new node instead of classic C function like `oneMinus( texture( map ).rgb )`.

```js
// it will invert the texture color
material.colorNode = texture( map ).rgb.oneMinus();
```

You can use mathematical operators on any node, e.g:

```js
const contrast = .5;
const brightness = .5;

material.colorNode = texture( map ).mul( contrast ).add( brightness );
```

## Render Pipeline

The `RenderPipeline` provides full control over the rendering process. It enables developers to build complex multi-pass rendering pipelines entirely in JavaScript, combining scene rendering, post-processing, and compute operations in a unified, composable workflow.

#### Basic Usage

```js
import * as THREE from 'three/webgpu';
import { pass } from 'three/tsl';

// Create the render pipeline
const renderPipeline = new THREE.RenderPipeline( renderer );

// Create a scene pass
const scenePass = pass( scene, camera );

// Set the output
renderPipeline.outputNode = scenePass;

// In the animation loop
function animate() {

	renderPipeline.render();

}
```

### Multiple Render Targets (MRT)

MRT allows capturing multiple outputs from a single render pass. Instead of rendering the scene multiple times to get different data (color, normals, depth, velocity), MRT captures all of them in one draw call—significantly improving performance.

#### Setting up MRT

Use `setMRT()` with the `mrt()` function to define which outputs to capture:

```js
import { pass, mrt, output, normalView, velocity, directionToColor } from 'three/tsl';

const scenePass = pass( scene, camera );

scenePass.setMRT( mrt( {
	output: output,                          // Final color output
	normal: directionToColor( normalView ),  // View-space normals encoded as colors
	velocity: velocity                       // Motion vectors for temporal effects
} ) );
```

Each MRT entry accepts any TSL node, allowing you to customize outputs using formulas, encoders, or material accessors. For example, `directionToColor( normalView )` encodes view-space normals into RGB values. You can use any TSL function to transform, combine, or encode data before writing to the render target.

Within a TSL function `Fn( ( { material, object } ) => { ... } )`, you have complete access to the current material and object being rendered, enabling full customization of outputs.

#### Accessing MRT Buffers

Each MRT output becomes available as a texture node via `getTextureNode()`:

```js
// Access individual buffers as texture nodes
const colorTexture = scenePass.getTextureNode( 'output' );
const normalTexture = scenePass.getTextureNode( 'normal' );
const velocityTexture = scenePass.getTextureNode( 'velocity' );

// Depth is always available, even without MRT
const depthTexture = scenePass.getTextureNode( 'depth' );
```

These texture nodes can be sampled, transformed, and passed to post-processing effects or other passes.

#### Optimizing MRT Textures

You can access the textures to optimize memory usage and bandwidth. Using smaller data types reduces GPU memory transfers, which is critical for performance on bandwidth-limited devices:

```js
// Use 8-bit format for encoded normals, default is 16-bit
const normalTexture = scenePass.getTexture( 'normal' );
normalTexture.type = THREE.UnsignedByteType;
```

#### Dynamic Pipeline Updates

The pipeline can be updated at runtime:

```js
if ( showNormals ) {

	renderPipeline.outputNode = prePass;

} else {

	renderPipeline.outputNode = traaPass;

}

renderPipeline.needsUpdate = true;
```
