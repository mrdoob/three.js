		<h1>[name]</h1>
		<div>
			<p>
				There are often times when you might need to use text in your three.js application - here are
				a couple of ways that you can do so.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h2>1. DOM + CSS</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Using HTML is generally the easiest and fastest manner to add text. This is the method
				used for descriptive overlays in most three.js examples.
			</p>
			<p>You can add content to a</p>
			<code>&lt;div id="info"&gt;Description&lt;/div&gt;</code>

			<p>
				and use CSS markup to position absolutely at a position above all others with a
				z-index especially if you are running three.js full screen.
			</p>

			<code>
#info {
	position: absolute;
	top: 10px;
	width: 100%;
	text-align: center;
	z-index: 100;
	display:block;
}
			</code>

		</div>



		<h2>2. Draw text to canvas and use as a [page:Texture]</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Use this method if you wish to draw text easily on a plane in your three.js scene.</p>
		</div>


		<h2>3. Create a model in your favourite 3D application and export to three.js</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Use this method if you prefer working with your 3d applications and importing the models to three.js</p>
		</div>



		<h2>4. Procedural Text Geometry</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				If you prefer to work purely in THREE.js or to create procedural and dynamic 3D
				text geometries, you can create a mesh whose geometry is an instance of THREE.TextGeometry:
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>new THREE.TextGeometry( text, parameters );</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				In order for this to work, however, your TextGeometry will need an instance of THREE.Font
				to be set on its "font" parameter.

				See the [page:TextGeometry] page for more info on how this can be done, descriptions of each
				accepted parameter, and a list of the JSON fonts that come with the THREE.js distribution itself.
			</p>

			<h3>Examples</h3>

			<p>
				[example:webgl_geometry_text WebGL / geometry / text]<br />
				[example:webgl_shadowmap WebGL / shadowmap]
			</p>

			<p>
				If Typeface is down, or you want to use a font that is not there, there's a tutorial
				with a python script for blender that allows you to export text to Three.js's JSON format:

			</p>

		</div>



		<h2>5. Bitmap Fonts</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				BMFonts (bitmap fonts) allow batching glyphs into a single BufferGeometry. BMFont rendering
				supports word-wrapping, letter spacing, kerning, signed distance fields with standard
				derivatives, multi-channel signed distance fields, multi-texture fonts, and more.
				See [link:https://github.com/felixmariotto/three-mesh-ui three-mesh-ui] or [link:https://github.com/Jam3/three-bmfont-text three-bmfont-text].
			</p>
			<p>
				Stock fonts are available in projects like
				[link:https://github.com/etiennepinchon/aframe-fonts A-Frame Fonts], or you can create your own
				from any .TTF font, optimizing to include only characters required for a project.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some helpful tools:

				<li>[link:https://github.com/soimy/msdf-bmfont-xml msdf-bmfont-xml] <i>(commandline)</i></li>
				<li>[link:https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Hiero hiero] <i>(desktop app)</i></li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h2>6. Troika Text</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				The [link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/troika-three-text troika-three-text] package renders 
				quality antialiased text using a similar technique as BMFonts, but works directly with any .TTF 
				or .WOFF font file so you don't have to pregenerate a glyph texture offline. It also adds 
				capabilities including:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Effects like strokes, drop shadows, and curvature</li>
				<li>The ability to apply any three.js Material, even a custom ShaderMaterial</li>
				<li>Support for font ligatures, scripts with joined letters, and right-to-left/bidirectional layout</li>
				<li>Optimization for large amounts of dynamic text, performing most work off the main thread in a web worker</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
