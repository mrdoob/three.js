		<div>
			While importing three.js via script tags is a great way to get up and running fast, it has a few drawbacks for longer lived projects, for example:
			<ul>
				<li>You have to manually fetch and include a copy of the library as part of your project's source code</li>
				<li>Updating the library's version is a manual process</li>
				<li>When checking in a new version of the library your version control diffs are cluttered by the many lines of the build file</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div>Using a dependency manager like npm avoids these caveats by allowing you to simply download and import your desired version of the libarary onto your machine.</div>

		<h2>Installation via npm</h2>

		<div>Three.js is published as an npm module, see: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/three" target="_blank">npm</a>. This means all you need to do to include three.js into your project is run "npm install three"</div>

		<h2>Importing the module</h2>

		<div>Assuming that you're bundling your files with a tool such as <a href="https://webpack.github.io/" target="_blank">Webpack</a> or <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-browserify" target="_blank">Browserify</a>, which allow you to "require('modules') in the browser by bundling up all of your dependencies."</div>

		<div>
			You should now be able to import the module into your source files and continue to use it as per normal.
		</div>

		<code>
		var THREE = require('three');

		var scene = new THREE.Scene();
		...
		</code>

		<div>
			You're also able to leverage <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import" target="_blank">ES6 import syntax</a>:
		</div>

		<code>
		import * as THREE from 'three';

		const scene = new THREE.Scene();
		...
		</code>

		<div>
			or if you wish to import only select parts of three.js library, for example Scene:
		</div>

		<code>
		import { Scene } from 'three';

		const scene = new Scene();
		...
		</code>

		<h2>Caveats</h2>

		<div>
			Currenlty it's not possible to import the files within the "examples/js" directroy in this way.
			This is due to some of the files relying on global namespace pollution of THREE. For more information see <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/9562" target="_blank">Transform `examples/js` to support modules #9562</a>.
