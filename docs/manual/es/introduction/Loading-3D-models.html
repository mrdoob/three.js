	<p>
		3D models are available in hundreds of file formats, each with different
		purposes, assorted features, and varying complexity. Although
		<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/jsm/loaders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
		three.js provides many loaders</a>, choosing the right format and
		workflow will save time and frustration later on. Some formats are
		difficult to work with, inefficient for realtime experiences, or simply not
		fully supported at this time.
	</p>

	<p>
		This guide provides a workflow recommended for most users, and suggestions
		for what to try if things don't go as expected.
	</p>

	<h2>Before we start</h2>

	<p>
		If you're new to running a local server, begin with
		[link:#manual/introduction/Installation installation]
		first. Many common errors viewing 3D models can be avoided by hosting files
		correctly.
	</p>

	<h2>Recommended workflow</h2>

	<p>
		Where possible, we recommend using glTF (GL Transmission Format). Both
		<small>.GLB</small> and <small>.GLTF</small> versions of the format are
		well supported. Because glTF is focused on runtime asset delivery, it is
		compact to transmit and fast to load. Features include meshes, materials,
		textures, skins, skeletons, morph targets, animations, lights, and
		cameras.
	</p>

	<p>
		Public-domain glTF files are available on sites like
		<a href="https://sketchfab.com/models?features=downloadable&sort_by=-likeCount&type=models" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
		Sketchfab</a>, or various tools include glTF export:

	</ul>

	<p>
		If your preferred tools do not support glTF, consider requesting glTF
		export from the authors, or posting on
		<a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/issues/1051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the glTF roadmap thread</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		When glTF is not an option, popular formats such as FBX, OBJ, or COLLADA
		are also available and regularly maintained.
	</p>

	<h2>Loading</h2>

	<p>
		Only a few loaders (e.g. [page:ObjectLoader]) are included by default with
		three.js â€” others should be added to your app individually.
	</p>

	<code>
		import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js';
	</code>

	<p>
		Once you've imported a loader, you're ready to add a model to your scene. Syntax varies among
		different loaders â€” when using another format, check the examples and documentation for that
		loader. For glTF, usage with global scripts would be:
	</p>

	<code>
		const loader = new GLTFLoader();

		loader.load( 'path/to/model.glb', function ( gltf ) {

			scene.add( gltf.scene );

		}, undefined, function ( error ) {

			console.error( error );

		} );
	</code>

	<p>
		See [page:GLTFLoader GLTFLoader documentation] for further details.
	</p>

	<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

	<p>
		You've spent hours modeling an artisanal masterpiece, you load it into
		the webpage, and â€” oh no! ðŸ˜­ It's distorted, miscolored, or missing entirely.
		Start with these troubleshooting steps:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			Check the JavaScript console for errors, and make sure you've used an
			`onError` callback when calling `.load()` to log the result.
		</li>
		<li>
			View the model in another application. For glTF, drag-and-drop viewers
			are available for
			<a href="https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three.js</a> and
			<a href="https://sandbox.babylonjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">babylon.js</a>. If the model
			appears correctly in one or more applications,
			<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">file a bug against three.js</a>.
			If the model cannot be shown in any application, we strongly encourage
			filing a bug with the application used to create the model.
		</li>
		<li>
			Try scaling the model up or down by a factor of 1000. Many models are
			scaled differently, and large models may not appear if the camera is
			inside the model.
		</li>
		<li>
			Try to add and position a light source. The model may be hidden in the dark.
		</li>
		<li>
			Look for failed texture requests in the network tab, like
			`"C:\\Path\To\Model\texture.jpg"`. Use paths relative to your
			model instead, such as `images/texture.jpg` â€” this may require
			editing the model file in a text editor.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Asking for help</h2>

	<p>
		If you've gone through the troubleshooting process above and your model
		still isn't working, the right approach to asking for help will get you to
		a solution faster. Post a question on the
		<a href="https://discourse.threejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three.js forum</a> and, whenever possible,
		include your model (or a simpler model with the same problem) in any formats
		you have available. Include enough information for someone else to reproduce
		the issue quickly â€” ideally, a live demo.
