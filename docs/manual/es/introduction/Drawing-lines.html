				Let's say you want to draw a line or a circle, not a wireframe [page:Mesh].
				First we need to set up the [page:WebGLRenderer renderer], [page:Scene scene] and camera (see the Creating a scene page).
			</p>

			<p>Here is the code that we will use:</p>
			<code>
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 45, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 1, 500 );
camera.position.set( 0, 0, 100 );
camera.lookAt( 0, 0, 0 );

const scene = new THREE.Scene();
			</code>
			<p>Next thing we will do is define a material. For lines we have to use [page:LineBasicMaterial] or [page:LineDashedMaterial].</p>
			<code>
//create a blue LineBasicMaterial
const material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial( { color: 0x0000ff } );
			</code>

			<p>
				After material we will need a geometry with some vertices:
			</p>

			<code>
const points = [];
points.push( new THREE.Vector3( - 10, 0, 0 ) );
points.push( new THREE.Vector3( 0, 10, 0 ) );
points.push( new THREE.Vector3( 10, 0, 0 ) );

const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry().setFromPoints( points );
			</code>

			<p>Note that lines are drawn between each consecutive pair of vertices, but not between the first and last (the line is not closed.)</p>

			<p>Now that we have points for two lines and a material, we can put them together to form a line.</p>
			<code>
const line = new THREE.Line( geometry, material );
			</code>
			<p>All that's left is to add it to the scene and call [page:WebGLRenderer.render render].</p>

			<code>
scene.add( line );
renderer.render( scene, camera );
			</code>

			<p>You should now be seeing an arrow pointing upwards, made from two blue lines.</p>
