		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			<p>
				[name] is similar to [page:OrbitControls]. However, it does not maintain a constant camera [page:Object3D.up up] vector.
				That means if the camera orbits over the “north” and “south” poles, it does not flip to stay "right side up".
			</p>
			<p>
				Notice that [name] can only be used with a perspective camera. Use [page:OrthographicTrackballControls] when working with an orthographic camera.
			</p>
		</p>

		<h2>Example</h2>

		<p>[example:misc_controls_trackball misc / controls / trackball ]</p>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:PerspectiveCamera camera], [param:HTMLDOMElement domElement] )</h3>
		<p>
			<p>
				[page:PerspectiveCamera camera]: The perspective camera of the rendered scene.
			</p>
			<p>
				[page:HTMLDOMElement domElement]: (optional) The HTML element used for event listeners. By default this is the whole document,
				however if you only want the controls to work over a specific element (e.g. the canvas) you can specify that here.
			</p>
			<p>
				Creates a new instance of [name].
			</p>
		</p>

		<h2>Events</h2>

		<h3>change</h3>
		<p>
			Fires when the camera has been transformed by the controls.
		</p>

		<h3>start</h3>
		<p>
			Fires when an interaction (e.g. touch) was initiated.
		</p>

		<h3>end</h3>
		<p>
			Fires when an interaction has finished.
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>[property:HTMLDOMElement domElement]</h3>
		<p>
			The HTMLDOMElement used to listen for mouse / touch events. This must be passed in the constructor; changing it here will
			not set up new event listeners. Default is the whole document.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Number dynamicDampingFactor]</h3>
		<p>
			Defines the intensity of damping. Only considered if [page:.staticMoving staticMoving] is set to *false*. Default is *0.2*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean enabled]</h3>
		<p>
			Whether or not the controls are enabled.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array keys]</h3>
		<p>
			This array holds keycodes for controlling interactions.
			<ul>
				<li>When the first defined key is pressed, all mouse interactions (left, middle, right) performs orbiting.</li>
				<li>When the second defined key is pressed, all mouse interactions (left, middle, right) performs zooming.</li>
				<li>When the third defined key is pressed, all mouse interactions (left, middle, right) performs panning.</li>
			</ul>
			Default is *65, 83, 68* which represents A, S, D.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Number maxDistance]</h3>
		<p>
			 How far you can zoom in. Default is *Infinity*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Number minDistance]</h3>
		<p>
			 How far you can zoom in. Default is *0*.
		</p>

		<h3>
			[property:Object mouseButtons]</h3>
		<p>
			This object contains references to the mouse actions used by the controls.
			<ul>
				<li>.LEFT is assinged with *THREE.MOUSE.ROTATE*</li>
				<li>.MIDDLE is assinged with *THREE.MOUSE.ZOOM*</li>
				<li>.RIGHT is assinged with *THREE.MOUSE.PAN*</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean noPan]</h3>
		<p>
			Whether or not panning is disabled. Default is *false*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean noRotate]</h3>
		<p>
			Whether or not rotation is disabled. Default is *false*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean noZoom]</h3>
		<p>
			Whether or not zooming is disabled. Default is *false*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:PerspectiveCamera object]</h3>
		<p>
			The camera being controlled.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Number panSpeed]</h3>
		<p>
			The zoom speed. Default is *0.3*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Number rotateSpeed]</h3>
		<p>
			The rotation speed. Default is *1.0*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Object screen]</h3>
		<p>
			Represents the properties of the screen. Automatically set when [page:.handleResize handleResize]() is called.
			<ul>
				<li>left: Represents the offset in pixels to the screen's left boundary.</li>
				<li>top: Represents the offset in pixels to the screen's top boundary.</li>
				<li>width: Represents the screen width in pixels.</li>
				<li>height: Represents the screen height in pixels.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean staticMoving]</h3>
		<p>
			Whether or not damping is disabled. Default is *false*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Number zoomSpeed]</h3>
		<p>
			The zoom speed. Default is *1.2*.
		</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>[method:null checkDistances] ()</h3>
		<p>
			Ensures the controls stay in the range [minDistance, maxDistance]. Called by [page:.update update]().
		</p>

		<h3>[method:null dispose] ()</h3>
		<p>
			Should be called if the controls is no longer required.
		</p>
