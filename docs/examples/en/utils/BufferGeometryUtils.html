		A class containing utility functions for [page:BufferGeometry BufferGeometry] instances.
		</p>


		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>[method:null computeTangents]( [param:BufferGeometry geometry] )</h3>
		<p>
		geometry -- A [page:BufferGeometry BufferGeometry] instance, which must have index, position, normal, and uv attributes.<br /><br />

		Calculates and adds tangent attribute to a geometry.

		</p>

		<h3>[method:BufferGeometry mergeBufferGeometries]( [param:Array geometries], [param:Boolean useGroups] )</h3>
		<p>
		geometries -- Array of [page:BufferGeometry BufferGeometry] instances.<br />
		useGroups -- Whether groups should be generated for the merged geometry or not.<br /><br />

		Merges a set of geometries into a single instance. All geometries must have compatible attributes.
		If merge does not succeed, the method returns null.

		</p>

		<h3>[method:BufferAttribute mergeBufferAttributes]( [param:Array attributes] )</h3>
		<p>
		attributes -- Array of [page:BufferAttribute BufferAttribute] instances.<br /><br />

		Merges a set of attributes into a single instance. All attributes must have compatible properties
		and types, and [page:InterleavedBufferAttribute InterleavedBufferAttributes] are not supported. If merge does not succeed, the method
		returns null.

		</p>

		<h3>[method:InterleavedBufferAttribute interleaveAttributes]( [param:Array attributes] )</h3>
		<p>
		attributes -- Array of [page:BufferAttribute BufferAttribute] instances.<br /><br />

		Interleaves a set of attributes and returns a new array of corresponding attributes that share
		a single InterleavedBuffer instance. All attributes must have compatible types. If merge does not
		succeed, the method returns null.

		</p>

		<h3>[method:Number estimateBytesUsed]( [param:BufferGeometry geometry] )</h3>
		<p>
		geometry -- Instance of [page:BufferGeometry BufferGeometry] to estimate the memory use of.<br /><br />

		Returns the amount of bytes used by all attributes to represent the geometry.

		</p>

		<h3>[method:BufferGeometry mergeVertices]( [param:BufferGeometry geometry], [param:Number tolerance] )</h3>
		<p>
		geometry -- Instance of [page:BufferGeometry BufferGeometry] to merge the vertices of.<br />
		tolerance -- The maximum allowable difference between vertex attributes to merge. Defaults to 1e-4.<br /><br />

		Returns a new [page:BufferGeometry BufferGeometry] with vertices for which all similar vertex attributes
		(within tolerance) are merged.

		</p>

		<h3>[method:BufferGeometry toTrianglesDrawMode]( [param:BufferGeometry geometry], [param:TrianglesDrawMode drawMode] )</h3>
		<p>
		geometry -- Instance of [page:BufferGeometry BufferGeometry].<br />
		drawMode -- The draw mode of the given geometry.<br /><br />

		Returns a new indexed [page:BufferGeometry BufferGeometry] based on the [page:DrawModes THREE.TrianglesDrawMode] draw mode. This mode
		corresponds to the *gl.TRIANGLES* WebGL primitive.
