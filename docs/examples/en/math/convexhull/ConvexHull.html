		<p class="desc">
			A convex hull class. Implements the Quickhull algorithm by: Dirk Gregorius. March 2014, Game Developers Conference: [link:http://media.steampowered.com/apps/valve/2014/DirkGregorius_ImplementingQuickHull.pdf Implementing QuickHull].

		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]()</h3>
		<p>
			Creates a new instance of [name].
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>[property:VertexList assigned]</h3>
		<p>
			This [page:VertexList vertex list] holds all vertices that are assigned to a face. Default is an empty vertex list.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array faces]</h3>
		<p>
			The generated faces of the convex hull. Default is an empty array.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array newFaces]</h3>
		<p>
			This array holds the faces that are generated within a single iteration. Default is an empty array.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float tolerance]</h3>
		<p>
			The epsilon value that is used for internal comparative operations. The calculation of this value depends on the size of the geometry. Default is -1.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:VertexList unassigned]</h3>
		<p>
			This [page:VertexList vertex list] holds all vertices that are not assigned to a face. Default is an empty vertex list.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array vertices]</h3>
		<p>
			The internal representation of the given geometry data (an array of [page:VertexNode vertices]).
		</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>[method:HalfEdge addAdjoiningFace]( [param:VertexNode eyeVertex], [param:HalfEdge horizonEdge] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:VertexNode eyeVertex] - The vertex that is added to the hull.<br />
			[page:HalfEdge horizonEdge] - A single edge of the horizon.<br /><br />

			Creates a face with the vertices 'eyeVertex.point', 'horizonEdge.tail' and 'horizonEdge.head' in CCW order.
			All the half edges are created in CCW order thus the face is always pointing outside the hull
		</p>

		<h3>[method:ConvexHull addNewFaces]( [param:VertexNode eyeVertex], [param:HalfEdge horizonEdge] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:VertexNode eyeVertex] - The vertex that is added to the hull.<br />
			[page:HalfEdge horizon] - An array of half-edges that form the horizon.<br /><br />

			Adds 'horizon.length' faces to the hull, each face will be linked with the horizon opposite face and the face on the left/right.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:ConvexHull addVertexToFace]( [param:VertexNode vertex], [param:Face face]	)</h3>
		<p>
			[page:VertexNodeNode vertex] - The vertex to add.<br />
			[page:Face face] - The target face.<br /><br />

			Adds a vertex to the 'assigned' list of vertices and assigns it to the given face.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:ConvexHull addVertexToHull]( [param:VertexNode eyeVertex] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:VertexNode eyeVertex] - The vertex that is added to the hull.<br /><br />

			Adds a vertex to the hull with the following algorithm
			<ul>
				<li>Compute the 'horizon' which is a chain of half edges. For an edge to belong to this group it must be the edge connecting a face that can see 'eyeVertex' and a face which cannot see 'eyeVertex'.</li>
				<li>All the faces that can see 'eyeVertex' have its visible vertices removed from the assigned vertex list.</li>
				<li>A new set of faces is created with each edge of the 'horizon' and 'eyeVertex'. Each face is connected with the opposite horizon face and the face on the left/right.</li>
				<li>The vertices removed from all the visible faces are assigned to the new faces if possible.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>[method:ConvexHull cleanup]()</h3>

		<p>Cleans up internal properties after computing the convex hull.</p>

		<h3>[method:ConvexHull compute]()</h3>

		<p>Starts the execution of the quick hull algorithm.</p>

			[page:Face face] - The current face being tested.<br />
			[page:Array horizon] - The edges that form part of the horizon in CCW order.<br /><br />

			Computes a chain of half edges in CCW order called the 'horizon'. For an edge to be part of the horizon it must join a face that can see 'eyePoint' and a face that cannot see 'eyePoint'.

		<h3>[method:ConvexHull computeInitialHull]()</h3>

		<p>Computes the initial simplex assigning to its faces all the points that are candidates to form part of the hull.</p>

			Removes all the visible vertices that 'face' is able to see.
			<ul>
				<li>If 'absorbingFace' doesn't exist, then all the removed vertices will be added to the 'unassigned' vertex list.</li>
				<li>If 'absorbingFace' exists, then this method will assign all the vertices of 'face' that can see 'absorbingFace'.</li>
				<li>If a vertex cannot see 'absorbingFace', it's added to the 'unassigned' vertex list.</li>

		<h3>[method:ConvexHull makeEmpty]()</h3>

		<p>Makes this convex hull empty.</p>

		<h3>[method:VertexNode nextVertexToAdd]()</h3>

		<p>Finds the next vertex to create faces with the current hull.
			<ul>
				<li>Let the initial face be the first face existing in the 'assigned' vertex list.</li>
				<li>If a face doesn't exist then return since there're no vertices left.</li>
