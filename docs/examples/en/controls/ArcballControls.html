		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
		Arcball controls allow the camera to be controlled by a virtual trackball with full touch support and advanced navigation functionality. <br>
		Cursor/finger positions and movements are mapped over a virtual trackball surface
		represented by a gizmo and mapped in intuitive and consistent camera movements.
		Dragging cursor/fingers will cause camera to orbit around the center of the trackball in a conservative way (returning to the starting point
		will make the camera to return to its starting orientation).<br><br>

		In addition to supporting pan, zoom and pinch gestures, Arcball controls provide <i>focus</i> functionality with a double click/tap for
		intuitively moving the object's point of interest in the center of the virtual trackball.
		Focus allows a much better inspection and navigation in complex environment.
		Moreover Arcball controls allow FOV manipulation (in a vertigo-style method) and z-rotation.
		Saving and restoring of Camera State is supported also through clipboard
		(use ctrl+c and ctrl+v shortcuts for copy and paste the state).<br><br>

		Unlike [page:OrbitControls] and [page:TrackballControls], [name] doesn't require [page:.update] to be called externally in an animation loop when animations
		are on.<br><br>


		To use this, as with all files in the /examples directory, you will have to
		include the file separately in your HTML.
		</p>

		<h2>Import</h2>

		<p>
			[name] is an add-on, and must be imported explicitly.
			See [link:#manual/introduction/Installation Installation / Addons].
		</p>

		<code>
			import { ArcballControls } from 'three/addons/controls/ArcballControls.js';
		</code>

		<h2>Code Example</h2>

		<code>
		const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
		renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
		document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

		const scene = new THREE.Scene();

		const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 45, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 1, 10000 );

		const controls = new ArcballControls( camera, renderer.domElement, scene );

		controls.addEventListener( 'change', function () {

			renderer.render( scene, camera );

		} );

		//controls.update() must be called after any manual changes to the camera's transform
		camera.position.set( 0, 20, 100 );
		controls.update();
		</code>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>[method:Boolean setMouseAction] ( [param:String operation], mouse, key )</h3>

		<h3>[method:Raycaster getRaycaster] ()</h3>
