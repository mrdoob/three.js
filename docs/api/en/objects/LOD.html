		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			Level of Detail - show meshes with more or less geometry based on distance from the camera.<br /><br />

		  Every level is associated with an object, and rendering can be switched between them at the distances
			specified. Typically you would create, say, three meshes, one for far away (low detail), one for mid range (medium detail)
			and one for close up (high detail).
		</p>

		<h2>Code Example</h2>

		<code>
		const lod = new THREE.LOD();

		//Create spheres with 3 levels of detail and create new LOD levels for them
		for( let i = 0; i < 3; i++ ) {

			const geometry = new THREE.IcosahedronGeometry( 10, 3 - i )

			const mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );

			lod.addLevel( mesh, i * 75 );

		}

		scene.add( lod );
		</code>

		<h2>Examples</h2>

		<p>
			[example:webgl_lod webgl / lod ]
		</p>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>
		<h3>[name]( )</h3>
		<p>
			Creates a new [name].
		</p>


		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Object3D] class for common properties.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean autoUpdate]</h3>
		<p>
		Whether the LOD object is updated automatically by the renderer per frame or not.
		If set to false, you have to call [page:LOD.update]() in the render loop by yourself.
		Default is true.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isLOD]</h3>
		<p>
			Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array levels]</h3>
		<p>
		An array of [page:Object level] objects<br /><br />

		Each level is an object with two properties:<br />
		[page:Object3D object] - The [page:Object3D] to display at this level.<br />
		[page:Float distance] - The distance at which to display this level of detail.
		</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Object3D] class for common methods.</p>

		<h3>[method:this addLevel]( [param:Object3D object], [param:Float distance] )</h3>
		<p>
		[page:Object3D object] - The [page:Object3D] to display at this level.<br />
		[page:Float distance] - The distance at which to display this level of detail.<br /><br />

		Adds a mesh that will display at a certain distance and greater. Typically the further away the distance,
		the lower the detail on the mesh.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:LOD clone]()</h3>
		<p>
		Returns a clone of this LOD object and its associated distance specific objects.
		</p>


		<h3>[method:Integer getCurrentLevel]()</h3>
		<p>
		Get the currently active LOD level. As index of the levels array.
		</p>



		<h3>[method:Object3D getObjectForDistance]( [param:Float distance] )</h3>
		<p>
		Get a reference to the first [page:Object3D] (mesh) that is greater than [page:Float distance].
		</p>

		<h3>[method:undefined raycast]( [param:Raycaster raycaster], [param:Array intersects] )</h3>
		<p>
		Get intersections between a casted [page:Ray] and this LOD.
		[page:Raycaster.intersectObject] will call this method.
		</p>



		<h3>[method:Object toJSON]( meta )</h3>
		<p>
		Create a JSON structure with details of this LOD object.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:undefined update]( [param:Camera camera] )</h3>
		<p>
			Set the visibility of each [page:levels level]'s [page:Object3D object] based on
			distance from the [page:Camera camera].
		</p>
