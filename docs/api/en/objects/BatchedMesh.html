		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			A special version of [page:Mesh] with multi draw batch rendering support. Use
			[name] if you have to render a large number of objects with the same
			material but with different world transformations and geometry. The usage
			of [name] will help you to reduce the number of draw calls and thus
			improve the overall rendering performance in your application.

			<br/>
			<br/>

			If the [link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WEBGL_multi_draw WEBGL_multi_draw extension] is
			not supported then a less performant callback is used.
		</p>

		<h2>Code Example</h2>

		<code>
		const box = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1 );
		const sphere = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1 );
		const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0x00ff00 } );

		// initialize and add geometries into the batched mesh
		const batchedMesh = new BatchedMesh( 10, 5000, 10000, material );
		const boxId = batchedMesh.addGeometry( box );
		const sphereId = batchedMesh.addGeometry( sphere );

		// position the geometries
		batchedMesh.setMatrixAt( boxId, boxMatrix );
		batchedMesh.setMatrixAt( sphereId, sphereMatrix );

		scene.add( batchedMesh );
		</code>

				[param:Integer maxGeometryCount], [param:Integer maxVertexCount],
				[param:Integer maxIndexCount], [param:Material material],
			)
		</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Integer maxGeometryCount] - the max number of individual geometries planned to be added.<br />
			[page:Integer maxVertexCount] - the max number of vertices to be used by all geometries.<br />
			[page:Integer maxIndexCount] - the max number of indices to be used by all geometries.<br />
			[page:Material material] - an instance of [page:Material]. Default is a
			new [page:MeshBasicMaterial].<br />
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Mesh] class for common properties.</p>

		<h3>[property:Box3 boundingBox]</h3>
		<p>
			This bounding box encloses all instances of the [name]. Can be calculated
			with [page:.computeBoundingBox](). Default is `null`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Sphere boundingSphere]</h3>
		<p>
			This bounding sphere encloses all instances of the [name]. Can be
			calculated with [page:.computeBoundingSphere](). Default is `null`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean perObjectFrustumCulled]</h3>
		<p>
			If true then the individual objects within the [name] are frustum culled. Default is `true`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean sortObjects]</h3>
		<p>
			If true then the individual objects within the [name] are sorted to improve overdraw-related artifacts.
			If the material is marked as "transparent" objects are rendered back to front and if not then they are
			rendered front to back. Default is `true`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer maxGeometryCount]</h3>
		<p>
			The maximum number of individual geometries that can be stored in the [name]. Read only.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isBatchedMesh]</h3>
		<p>Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Mesh] class for common methods.</p>

		<h3>[method:undefined computeBoundingBox]()</h3>
		<p>
			Computes the bounding box, updating [page:.boundingBox] attribute.<br />
			Bounding boxes aren't computed by default. They need to be explicitly
			computed, otherwise they are `null`.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:undefined computeBoundingSphere]()</h3>
		<p>
			Computes the bounding sphere, updating [page:.boundingSphere]
			attribute.<br />
			Bounding spheres aren't computed by default. They need to be explicitly
			computed, otherwise they are `null`.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:undefined dispose]()</h3>
		<p>
			Frees the GPU-related resources allocated by this instance. Call this
			method whenever this instance is no longer used in your app.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:this setCustomSort]( [param:Function sortFunction] )</h3>
		<p>
			Takes a sort a function that is run before render. The function takes a list of items to sort and a camera. The objects
			in the list include a "z" field to perform a depth-ordered sort with.
		</p>

		<h3>
			[method:Matrix4 getMatrixAt]( [param:Integer index], [param:Matrix4 matrix] )
		</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Integer index]: The index of an instance. Values have to be in the
			range [0, count].
		</p>
		<p>
			[page:Matrix4 matrix]: This 4x4 matrix will be set to the local
			transformation matrix of the defined instance.
		</p>
		<p>Get the local transformation matrix of the defined instance.</p>

		<h3>
			[method:Boolean getVisibleAt]( [param:Integer index] )

			of a single instance.

		<p>
			[page:BufferGeometry geometry]: The geometry to add into the [name].
		</p>
		<p>
			[page:Integer reservedVertexRange]: Optional parameter specifying the amount of vertex buffer space to reserve for the added geometry. This
			is necessary if it is planned to set a new geometry at this index at a later time that is larger than the original geometry. Defaults to
			the length of the given geometry vertex buffer.
		</p>
		<p>
			[page:Integer reservedIndexRange]: Optional parameter specifying the amount of index buffer space to reserve for the added geometry. This
			is necessary if it is planned to set a new geometry at this index at a later time that is larger than the original geometry. Defaults to
