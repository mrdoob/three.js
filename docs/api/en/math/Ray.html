		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			A ray that emits from an origin in a certain direction. This is used by
			the [page:Raycaster] to assist with
			[link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting raycasting]. Raycasting is
			used for mouse picking (working out what objects in the 3D space the mouse
			is over) amongst other things.
		</p>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:Vector3 origin], [param:Vector3 direction] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Vector3 origin] - (optional) the origin of the [page:Ray]. Default
			is a [page:Vector3] at (0, 0, 0).<br />
			[page:Vector3 direction] - [page:Vector3] The direction of the [page:Ray].
			This must be normalized (with [page:Vector3.normalize]) for the methods to
			operate properly. Default is a [page:Vector3] at (0, 0, -1).<br /><br />

			Creates a new [name].
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Vector3 direction]</h3>
		<p>
