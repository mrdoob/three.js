			y) boundary of the box. Default is ( - Infinity, - Infinity ).<br /><br />

			Creates a [name] bounded by min and max.

		<h3>[property:Vector2 min]</h3>
		<p>

		<h3>[property:Vector2 max]</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Vector2] representing the lower upper (x, y) boundary of the box.<br />

		</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>
			[method:Vector2 clampPoint]( [param:Vector2 point], [param:Vector2 target] )
		</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Vector2 point] - [page:Vector2] to clamp. <br />
			[page:Vector2 target] — the result will be copied into this Vector2.<br /><br />

		<h3>[method:Boolean containsBox]( [param:Box2 box] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Box2 box] - [page:Box2 Box2] to test for inclusion.<br /><br />

			Returns true if this box includes the entirety of [page:Box2 box]. If this
			and [page:Box2 box] are identical, <br />
			this function also returns true.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Boolean containsPoint]( [param:Vector2 point] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Vector2 point] - [page:Vector2] to check for inclusion.<br /><br />

			Returns true if the specified [page:Vector2 point] lies within or on the
			boundaries of this box.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:this copy]( [param:Box2 box] )</h3>
		<p>
			Copies the [page:.min min] and [page:.max max] from [page:Box2 box] to
			this box.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Float distanceToPoint]( [param:Vector2 point] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Vector2 point] - [page:Vector2] to measure distance to.<br /><br />

			Returns the distance from any edge of this box to the specified point. If
			the [page:Vector2 point] lies inside of this box, the distance will be `0`.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Boolean equals]( [param:Box2 box] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Box2 box] - Box to compare with this one.<br /><br />

			Returns true if this box and [page:Box2 box] share the same lower and
			upper bounds.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:this expandByPoint]( [param:Vector2 point] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Vector2 point] - [page:Vector2] that should be included in the
			box.<br /><br />

			Expands the boundaries of this box to include [page:Vector2 point].
		</p>

		<h3>[method:this expandByScalar]( [param:Float scalar] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Float scalar] - Distance to expand the box by.<br /><br />

			Expands each dimension of the box by [page:Float scalar]. If negative, the
			dimensions of the box will be contracted.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:this expandByVector]( [param:Vector2 vector] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Vector2 vector] - [page:Vector2] to expand the box by.<br /><br />

			Expands this box equilaterally by [page:Vector2 vector]. The width of this
			box will be expanded by the x component of [page:Vector2 vector] in both
			directions. The height of this box will be expanded by the y component of
			[page:Vector2 vector] in both directions.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Vector2 getCenter]( [param:Vector2 target] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Vector2 target] — the result will be copied into this Vector2.<br /><br />

			Returns the center point of the box as a [page:Vector2].
		</p>

		<h3>
			[method:Vector2 getParameter]( [param:Vector2 point], [param:Vector2 target] )
		</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Vector2 point] - [page:Vector2].<br />
			[page:Vector2 target] — the result will be copied into this Vector2.<br /><br />

			Returns a point as a proportion of this box's width and height.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Vector2 getSize]( [param:Vector2 target] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Vector2 target] — the result will be copied into this Vector2.<br /><br />

			Returns the width and height of this box.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:this intersect]( [param:Box2 box] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Box2 box] - Box to intersect with.<br /><br />

			Returns the intersection of this and [page:Box2 box], setting the upper
			bound of this box to the lesser of the two boxes' upper bounds and the
			lower bound of this box to the greater of the two boxes' lower bounds.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Boolean intersectsBox]( [param:Box2 box] )</h3>
		<p>

			Determines whether or not this box intersects [page:Box2 box].
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Boolean isEmpty]()</h3>
		<p>
			Returns true if this box includes zero points within its bounds.<br />
			Note that a box with equal lower and upper bounds still includes one
			point, the one both bounds share.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:this makeEmpty]()</h3>
		<p>Makes this box empty.</p>

		<h3>[method:this set]( [param:Vector2 min], [param:Vector2 max] )</h3>
		<p>

		</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Vector2 center] - Desired center position of the box
			([page:Vector2]). <br />
			[page:Vector2 size] - Desired x and y dimensions of the box
			([page:Vector2]).<br /><br />

			Centers this box on [page:Vector2 center] and sets this box's width and
			height to the values specified in [page:Vector2 size].
		</p>

		<h3>[method:this setFromPoints]( [param:Array points] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Array points] - Array of [page:Vector2 Vector2s] that the resulting
			box will contain.<br /><br />

			Sets the upper and lower bounds of this box to include all of the points
			in [page:Array points].
		</p>

		<h3>[method:this translate]( [param:Vector2 offset] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Vector2 offset] - Direction and distance of offset.<br /><br />

			Adds [page:Vector2 offset] to both the upper and lower bounds of this box,
			effectively moving this box [page:Vector2 offset] units in 2D space.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:this union]( [param:Box2 box] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Box2 box] - Box that will be unioned with this box.<br /><br />
