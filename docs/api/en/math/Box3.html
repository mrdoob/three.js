		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			Represents an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) in 3D space.
		</p>

		<h2>Code Example</h2>

		<code>
		const box = new THREE.Box3();

		const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(
			new THREE.SphereGeometry(),
			new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial()
		);

		// ensure the bounding box is computed for its geometry
		// this should be done only once (assuming static geometries)
		mesh.geometry.computeBoundingBox();

		// ...

		// in the animation loop, compute the current bounding box with the world matrix
		box.copy( mesh.geometry.boundingBox ).applyMatrix4( mesh.matrixWorld );
		</code>
