		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			Serves as a base class for the other shadow classes.
		</p>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:Camera camera] )</h3>
		<p>
		[page:Camera camera] - the light's view of the world.<br /><br />

		Create a new [name]. This is not intended to be called directly - it is used as a base class by 
		other light shadows.
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>[property:Camera camera]</h3>
		<p>
			The light's view of the world. This is used to generate a depth map of the scene; objects behind
			other objects from the light's perspective will be in shadow.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float bias]</h3>
		<p>
			Shadow map bias, how much to add or subtract from the normalized depth when deciding whether a surface is in shadow.<br />
			The default is 0. Very tiny adjustments here (in the order of 0.0001) may help reduce artefacts in shadows
		</p>

		<h3>[property:WebGLRenderTarget map]</h3>
		<p>
			The depth map generated using the internal camera; a location beyond a pixel's depth is
			in shadow. Computed internally during rendering.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:WebGLRenderTarget mapPass]</h3>
		<p>
			The distribution map generated using the internal camera; an occlusion is calculated based 
			on the distribution of depths. Computed internally during rendering.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Vector2 mapSize]</h3>
		<p>
			A [Page:Vector2] defining the width and height of the shadow map.<br /><br />

			Higher values give better quality shadows at the cost of computation time. Values must be
			powers of 2, up to the [page:WebGLRenderer.capabilities].maxTextureSize for a given device,
			although the width and height don't have to be the same (so, for example, (512, 1024) is valid).
			The default is *( 512, 512 )*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Matrix4 matrix]</h3>
		<p>
			Model to shadow camera space, to compute location and depth in shadow map. Stored
			in a [page:Matrix4 Matrix4]. This is computed internally during rendering.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float radius]</h3>
		<p>
			Setting this to values greater than 1 will blur the edges of the shadow.<br />

			High values will cause unwanted banding effects in the shadows - a greater [page:.mapSize mapSize]
			will allow for a higher value to be used here before these effects become visible.<br /><br />

			Note that this has no effect if the [page:WebGLRenderer.shadowMap.type] is set to [page:Renderer BasicShadowMap].
		</p>


		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>[method:Vector2 getFrameExtents]()</h3>
		<p>
		Used internally by the renderer to extend the shadow map to contain all viewports
		</p>

		<h3>[method:null updateMatrices]( [param:Light light], [param:Camera viewCamera], [param:number viewportIndex])</h3>
		<p>
		Update the matrices for the camera and shadow, used internally by the renderer.<br /><br />

		light -- the light for which the shadow is being rendered.<br />
		viewCamera -- the camera view for which the shadow is being rendered.<br />
		viewportIndex -- calculates the matrix for this viewport
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Frustum getFrustum]()</h3>
		<p>
		Gets the shadow cameras frustum. Used internally by the renderer to cull objects.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:number getViewportCount]()</h3>
		<p>
		Used internally by the renderer to get the number of viewports that need to be rendered for this shadow.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:LightShadow copy]( [param:LightShadow source] )</h3>
		<p>
		Copies value of all the properties from the [page:LightShadow source] to this
		Light.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:LightShadow clone]()</h3>
		<p>
		Creates a new LightShadow with the same properties as this one.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Object toJSON]()</h3>
		<p>
		Serialize this LightShadow.
		</p>
