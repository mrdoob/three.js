		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			A light that gets emitted from a single point in all directions. A common use case for this
			is to replicate the light emitted from a bare lightbulb.<br /><br />

			 This light can cast shadows - see [page:LightShadow] page for details.

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:Integer color], [param:Float intensity], [param:Number distance], [param:Float decay] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Integer color] - (optional) hexadecimal color of the light. Default is 0xffffff (white).<br />
			[page:Float intensity] - (optional) numeric value of the light's strength/intensity. Default is 1.<br /><br />
			[page:Number distance] - Maximum range of the light. Default is 0 (no limit).<br />
			[page:Float decay] - The amount the light dims along the distance of the light. Default is 1.
			For [page:WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights physically correct] lighting, set this to 2.<br /><br />

			Creates a new [name].
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<p>
			See the base [page:Light Light] class for common properties.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float decay]</h3>
		<p>
			The amount the light dims along the distance of the light<br />
			In [page:WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights physically correct] mode, decay = 2 leads to physically realistic light falloff.<br/>
			Default is *1*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float distance]</h3>
		<p>
			<em>Default mode</em> — When distance is zero, light does not attenuate. When distance is
			non-zero, light will attenuate linearly from maximum intensity at the light's position down to
			zero at this distance from the light.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>[page:WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights Physically correct] mode</em> — When distance
			is zero, light will attenuate according to inverse-square law to infinite distance. When
			distance is non-zero, a more sudden cutoff is applied at this distance from the light, in
			addition to inverse-square attenuation, limiting the light's range.
		</p>
		<p>
			Default is *0.0*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isPointLight]</h3>
		<p>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are point lights. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it used internally for optimisation.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float power]</h3>
		<p>
			The light's power.<br />
			In [page:WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights physically correct] mode, the luminous
			power of the light measured in lumens. Default is *4Math.PI*. <br /><br />

			This is directly related to the [page:.intensity intensity] in the ratio
			<code>
				power = intensity * 4&pi;
			</code>
			and changing this will also change the intensity.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:LightShadow shadow]</h3>
		<p>
			A [page:LightShadow] used to calculate shadows for this light.<br /><br />

			 The lightShadow's [page:LightShadow.camera camera]
			is set to a  [page:PerspectiveCamera] with [page:PerspectiveCamera.fov fov] of 90,
			[page:PerspectiveCamera.aspect aspect] of 1, [page:PerspectiveCamera.near near]
			clipping plane at 0.5 and	[page:PerspectiveCamera.far far] clipping plane at 500.
		</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<p>
			See the base [page:Light Light] class for common methods.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:PointLight copy]( [param:PointLight source] )</h3>
		<p>
		Copies value of all the properties from the [page:PointLight source] to this
		PointLight.
