		<h3>[property:Float oldTime]</h3>
		<p>
		Holds the time at which the clock's [page:Clock.start start], [page:.getElapsedTime]() or [page:.getDelta]()

		<h3>[method:undefined stop]()</h3>

		Stops clock and sets [page:Clock.oldTime oldTime] to the current time.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Float getElapsedTime]()</h3>
		<p>

		</p>

		<h3>[method:Float getDelta]()</h3>
		<p>
		Get the seconds passed since the time [page:.oldTime] was set and sets [page:.oldTime] to the current time.<br />
