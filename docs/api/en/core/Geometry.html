		<div class="desc">
		<p>
		Geometry is a user-friendly alternative to [page:BufferGeometry]. Geometries store attributes
		(vertex positions, faces, colors, etc.) using objects like [page:Vector3] or [page:Color] that
		are easier to read and edit, but less efficient than typed arrays.
		</p>
		<p>
		Prefer [page:BufferGeometry] for large or serious projects.
		</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]()</h3>
		<p>
		The constructor takes no arguments.
		</p>


		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>[property:Box3 boundingBox]</h3>
		<p>
			Bounding box for the Geometry, which can be calculated with
			[page:.computeBoundingBox](). Default is *null*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Sphere boundingSphere]</h3>
		<p>
			Bounding sphere for the Geometry, which can be calculated with
			[page:.computeBoundingSphere](). Default is *null*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array colors]</h3>
		<p>
		Array of vertex [page:Color colors], matching number and order of vertices.<br /><br />

		This is used by [page:Points] and [page:Line] and any classes derived from those such as [page:LineSegments] and various helpers.
		[page:Mesh Meshes] use [page:Face3.vertexColors] instead of this.<br /><br />

		To signal an update in this array, [page:Geometry Geometry.colorsNeedUpdate] needs to be set to true.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array faces]</h3>
		<p>
		Array of [page:Face3 faces].<br />
		The array of faces describe how each vertex in the model is connected to form faces.
		Additionally it holds information about face and vertex normals and colors.<br /><br />
		To signal an update in this array, [page:Geometry Geometry.elementsNeedUpdate] needs to be set to true.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array faceVertexUvs]</h3>
		<p>
		Array of face [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping UV] layers, used for mapping textures onto the geometry.<br />
		Each UV layer is an array of [page:UV]s matching the order and number of vertices in faces.<br /><br />
		To signal an update in this array, [page:Geometry Geometry.uvsNeedUpdate] needs to be set to true.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer id]</h3>
		<p>Unique number for this geometry instance.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isGeometry]</h3>
		<p>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are Geometries. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it used internally for optimisation.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:array lineDistances]</h3>
		<p>
		An array containing distances between vertices for Line geometries.
		This is required for [page:LineDashedMaterial] to render correctly.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array morphTargets]</h3>
		<p>
		Array of [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morph_target_animation morph targets]. Each morph target is a Javascript object:
		<code>{ name: "targetName", vertices: [ new THREE.Vector3(), ... ] }</code>
		Morph vertices match number and order of primary vertices.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array morphNormals]</h3>
		<p>
		Array of morph normals. Morph normals have similar structure as morph targets, each normal set is a Javascript object:
		<code>morphNormal = { name: "NormalName", normals: [ new THREE.Vector3(), ... ] }</code>

		See the [example:webgl_morphnormals WebGL / morphNormals] example.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:String name]</h3>
		<p>Optional name for this geometry. Default is an empty string.</p>

		<h3>[property:Array skinWeights]</h3>
		<p>
		When working with a [page:SkinnedMesh], each vertex can have up to 4 [page:Bone bones] affecting it.
		The skinWeights property is an array of weight values that correspond to the order of the vertices in
		the geometry. So for instance, the first skinWeight would correspond to the first vertex in the geometry.
		Since each vertex can be modified by 4 bones, a [page:Vector4] is used to represent the skin weights
		for that vertex.
		</p>
		<p>
		The values of the vector should typically be between 0 and 1. For instance when set to 0 the bone
		transformation will have no affect. When set to 0.5 it will have 50% affect. When set to 100%, it will
		have 100% affect. If there is only 1 bone associated with the vertex then you only need to worry about
		the first component of the vector, the rest can be ignored and set to 0.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array skinIndices]</h3>
		<p>
		Just like the skinWeights property, the skinIndices' values correspond to the geometry's vertices.
		Each vertex can have up to 4 bones associated with it. So if you look at the first vertex, and the
		first skinIndex, this will tell you the bones associated with that vertex. For example the first vertex
		could have a value of <strong>( 10.05, 30.10, 12.12 )</strong>. Then the first skin index could have the
		value of <strong>( 10, 2, 0, 0 )</strong>. The first skin weight could have the value of
		<strong>( 0.8, 0.2, 0, 0 )</strong>. In affect this would take the first vertex, and then the bone
		<strong>mesh.bones[10]</strong> and apply it 80% of the way. Then it would take the bone <strong>skeleton.bones[2]</strong>
		and apply it 20% of the way. The next two values have a weight of 0, so they would have no affect.
		</p>
		<p>
		In code another example could look like this:
		<code>
		// e.g.
		geometry.skinIndices[15] = new THREE.Vector4(   0,   5,   9, 10 );
		geometry.skinWeights[15] = new THREE.Vector4( 0.2, 0.5, 0.3,  0 );

		// corresponds with the following vertex
		geometry.vertices[15];

		// these bones will be used like so:
		skeleton.bones[0]; // weight of 0.2
		skeleton.bones[5]; // weight of 0.5
		skeleton.bones[9]; // weight of 0.3
		skeleton.bones[10]; // weight of 0
		</code>
		</p>

		This gets automatically assigned and shouldn't be edited.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array vertices]</h3>
		<p>
		Array of [page:Vector3 vertices].<br />
		The array of vertices holds the position of every vertex in the model.<br />
		To signal an update in this array, [page:.verticesNeedUpdate] needs to be set to true.
