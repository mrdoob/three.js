		<p class="desc">Provides utility functions for managing uniforms.</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>[method:Object clone]( [param:Object src] )</h3>
		<p>
			src -- An object representing uniform definitions.<br /><br />

			Clones the given uniform definitions by performing a deep-copy. That means
			if the [page:Uniform.value value] of a uniform refers to an object like a
			[page:Vector3] or [page:Texture], the cloned uniform will refer to a new
			object reference.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Object merge]( [param:Array uniforms] )</h3>
		<p>
			uniforms -- An array of objects containing uniform definitions.<br /><br />

			Merges the given uniform definitions into a single object. Since the
			method internally uses [page:.clone](), it performs a deep-copy when
			producing the merged uniform definitions.
