		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			This class generates a Prefiltered, Mipmapped Radiance Environment Map
			(PMREM) from a cubeMap environment texture. This allows different levels
			of blur to be quickly accessed based on material roughness. Unlike a
			traditional mipmap chain, it only goes down to the LOD_MIN level (above),
			and then creates extra even more filtered 'mips' at the same LOD_MIN
			resolution, associated with higher roughness levels. In this way we
			maintain resolution to smoothly interpolate diffuse lighting while
			limiting sampling computation.<br /><br />

			Note: The minimum [page:MeshStandardMaterial]'s roughness depends on the
			size of the provided texture. If your render has small dimensions or the
			shiny parts have a lot of curvature, you may still be able to get away
			with a smaller texture size.

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:WebGLRenderer renderer] )</h3>
		<p>This constructor creates a new [name].</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>
			[method:WebGLRenderTarget fromScene]( [param:Scene scene], [param:Number sigma], [param:Number near], [param:Number far], [param:Object options] )
		</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Scene scene] - The given scene.<br />
			[page:Number sigma] - (optional) Specifies a blur radius in radians to be
			applied to the scene before PMREM generation. Default is `0`.<br />
			[page:Number near] - (optional) The near plane value. Default is `0.1`.<br />
			[page:Number far] - (optional) The far plane value. Default is `100`.<br />
			[page:Object options] - (optional) The configuration options. It allows to define
			the `size` of the PMREM as a number well as the `position` of the internal cube camera as
			an instance of `Vector3`.<br /><br />

			Generates a PMREM from a supplied Scene, which can be faster than using an
			image if networking bandwidth is low. Optional near and far planes ensure
			the scene is rendered in its entirety.
		</p>

		<h3>
			[method:WebGLRenderTarget fromEquirectangular]( [param:Texture equirectangular] )
		</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Texture equirectangular] - The equirectangular texture.<br /><br />

			Generates a PMREM from an equirectangular texture.
		</p>

		<h3>
			[method:WebGLRenderTarget fromCubemap]( [param:CubeTexture cubemap] )
		</h3>
		<p>
			[page:CubeTexture cubemap] - The cubemap texture.<br /><br />

			Generates a PMREM from an cubemap texture.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:undefined compileCubemapShader]()</h3>
		<p>
			Pre-compiles the cubemap shader. You can get faster start-up by invoking
			this method during your texture's network fetch for increased concurrency.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:undefined compileEquirectangularShader]()</h3>
		<p>
			Pre-compiles the equirectangular shader. You can get faster start-up by
			invoking this method during your texture's network fetch for increased
			concurrency.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:undefined dispose]()</h3>
		<p>
			Frees the GPU-related resources allocated by this instance. Call this
			method whenever this instance is no longer used in your app.
