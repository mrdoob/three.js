		<h2>Revision Number</h2>

		<code>
THREE.REVISION

		<div id="rev">
			The current three.js [link:https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/releases revision number].

		<h2>Color Spaces</h2>
		<code>
THREE.NoColorSpace			
THREE.SRGBColorSpace
THREE.LinearSRGBColorSpace
		</code>
		<p>
			[page:NoColorSpace] defines no specific color space. 
		</p>
		<p>
			[page:SRGBColorSpace] (“sRGB”) refers to the color space defined by the Rec. 709 primaries, D65
			white point, and nonlinear sRGB transfer functions. sRGB is the default color space in
			CSS, and is often found in color palettes and color pickers. Colors expressed in
			hexadecimal or CSS notation are typically in the sRGB color space.
		</p>

		<p>
			[page:LinearSRGBColorSpace] (“Linear-sRGB”) refers to the sRGB color space (above) with
			linear transfer functions. Linear-sRGB is the working color space in three.js, used
			throughout most of the rendering process. RGB components found in three.js materials
			and shaders are in the Linear-sRGB color space.
