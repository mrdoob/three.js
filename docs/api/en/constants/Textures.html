		<h1>Texture Constants</h1>

		<h2>Mapping Modes</h2>
		<code>
		THREE.UVMapping
		THREE.CubeReflectionMapping 
		THREE.CubeRefractionMapping
		THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping
		THREE.EquirectangularRefractionMapping 
		THREE.CubeUVReflectionMapping
		</code>

		<p>
			These define the texture's mapping mode.<br />
			[page:Constant UVMapping] is the default, and maps the texture using the
			mesh's UV coordinates.<br /><br />
			The rest define environment mapping types.<br /><br />
			[page:Constant CubeReflectionMapping] and [page:Constant CubeRefractionMapping] are for use with a [page:CubeTexture CubeTexture],
			which is made up of six textures, one for each face of the cube.
			[page:Constant CubeReflectionMapping] is the default for a
			[page:CubeTexture CubeTexture]. <br /><br />
			[page:Constant EquirectangularReflectionMapping] and [page:Constant EquirectangularRefractionMapping] are for use with an equirectangular
			environment map. Also called a lat-long map, an equirectangular texture
			represents a 360-degree view along the horizontal centerline, and a
			180-degree view along the vertical axis, with the top and bottom edges of
			the image corresponding to the north and south poles of a mapped
			sphere.<br /><br />
			See the [example:webgl_materials_envmaps materials / envmaps] example.
		</p>

		<h2>Wrapping Modes</h2>
		<code>
		THREE.RepeatWrapping 
		THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping
		THREE.MirroredRepeatWrapping
		</code>
		<p>
			These define the texture's [page:Texture.wrapS wrapS] and
			[page:Texture.wrapT wrapT] properties, which define horizontal and
			vertical texture wrapping.<br /><br />
			With [page:constant RepeatWrapping] the texture will simply repeat to
			infinity.<br /><br />
			[page:constant ClampToEdgeWrapping] is the default. The last pixel of the
			texture stretches to the edge of the mesh.<br /><br />
			With [page:constant MirroredRepeatWrapping] the texture will repeats to
			infinity, mirroring on each repeat.
		</p>

		<h2>Magnification Filters</h2>
		<code>
		THREE.NearestFilter 
		THREE.LinearFilter
		</code>

		<p>
			For use with a texture's [page:Texture.magFilter magFilter] property,
			these define the texture magnification function to be used when the pixel
			being textured maps to an area less than or equal to one texture element
			(texel).<br /><br />

			[page:constant NearestFilter] returns the value of the texture element
			that is nearest (in Manhattan distance) to the specified texture
			coordinates.<br /><br />

			[page:constant LinearFilter] is the default and returns the weighted
			average of the four texture elements that are closest to the specified
			texture coordinates, and can include items wrapped or repeated from other
			parts of a texture, depending on the values of [page:Texture.wrapS wrapS]
			and [page:Texture.wrapT wrapT], and on the exact mapping.
		</p>

		<h2>Minification Filters</h2>
		<code>
		THREE.NearestFilter 
		THREE.NearestMipmapNearestFilter
		THREE.NearestMipmapLinearFilter 
		THREE.LinearFilter
		THREE.LinearMipmapNearestFilter 
		THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter
		</code>

		<p>
			For use with a texture's [page:Texture.minFilter minFilter] property,
			these define the texture minifying function that is used whenever the
			pixel being textured maps to an area greater than one texture element
			(texel).<br /><br />

			In addition to [page:constant NearestFilter] and [page:constant LinearFilter], the following four functions can be used for
			minification:<br /><br />

			[page:constant NearestMipmapNearestFilter] chooses the mipmap that most
			closely matches the size of the pixel being textured and uses the
			[page:constant NearestFilter] criterion (the texel nearest to the center
			of the pixel) to produce a texture value.<br /><br />

			[page:constant NearestMipmapLinearFilter] chooses the two mipmaps that
			most closely match the size of the pixel being textured and uses the
			[page:constant NearestFilter] criterion to produce a texture value from
			each mipmap. The final texture value is a weighted average of those two
			values.<br /><br />

			[page:constant LinearMipmapNearestFilter] chooses the mipmap that most
			closely matches the size of the pixel being textured and uses the
			[page:constant LinearFilter] criterion (a weighted average of the four
			texels that are closest to the center of the pixel) to produce a texture
			value.<br /><br />

			[page:constant LinearMipmapLinearFilter] is the default and chooses the
			two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the pixel being textured
			and uses the [page:constant LinearFilter] criterion to produce a texture
			value from each mipmap. The final texture value is a weighted average of
			those two values.<br /><br />

			See the [example:webgl_materials_texture_filters materials / texture / filters] example.

		THREE.FloatType 
		THREE.HalfFloatType 
		THREE.UnsignedShort4444Type

		THREE.UnsignedInt248Type
		</code>
		<p>
			For use with a texture's [page:Texture.type type] property, which must
			correspond to the correct format. See below for details.<br /><br />

			[page:constant UnsignedByteType] is the default.
		</p>

		<h2>Formats</h2>
		<code>
		THREE.AlphaFormat 
		THREE.RedFormat

		THREE.RGIntegerFormat 
		THREE.RGBAFormat

		</code>
		<p>
			For use with a texture's [page:Texture.format format] property, these
			define how elements of a 2d texture, or `texels`, are read by shaders.<br /><br />

			[page:constant AlphaFormat] discards the red, green and blue components
			and reads just the alpha component.<br /><br />

			[page:constant RedFormat] discards the green and blue components and reads
			just the red component. (can only be used with a WebGL 2 rendering
			context).
			<br /><br />

			[page:constant RedIntegerFormat] discards the green and blue components
			and reads just the red component. The texels are read as integers instead
			of floating point. (can only be used with a WebGL 2 rendering context).
			<br /><br />

			[page:constant RGFormat] discards the alpha, and blue components and reads
			the red, and green components. (can only be used with a WebGL 2 rendering
			context).
			<br /><br />

			[page:constant RGIntegerFormat] discards the alpha, and blue components
			and reads the red, and green components. The texels are read as integers
			instead of floating point. (can only be used with a WebGL 2 rendering
			context).
			<br /><br />

			[page:constant RGBAFormat] is the default and reads the red, green, blue
			and alpha components.<br /><br />

			[page:constant RGBAIntegerFormat] is the default and reads the red, green,
			blue and alpha components. The texels are read as integers instead of
			floating point. (can only be used with a WebGL 2 rendering context).
			<br /><br />

			[page:constant LuminanceFormat] reads each element as a single luminance
			component. This is then converted to a floating point, clamped to the
			range [0,1], and then assembled into an RGBA element by placing the
			luminance value in the red, green and blue channels, and attaching 1.0 to
			the alpha channel.<br /><br />

			[page:constant LuminanceAlphaFormat] reads each element as a
			luminance/alpha double. The same process occurs as for the [page:constant LuminanceFormat], except that the alpha channel may have values other than
			`1.0`.<br /><br />

			[page:constant DepthFormat] reads each element as a single depth value,
			converts it to floating point, and clamps to the range [0,1]. This is the
			default for [page:DepthTexture DepthTexture].<br /><br />

			[page:constant DepthStencilFormat] reads each element is a pair of depth
			and stencil values. The depth component of the pair is interpreted as in
			[page:constant DepthFormat]. The stencil component is interpreted based on
			the depth + stencil internal format.
			<br /><br />

			Note that the texture must have the correct [page:Texture.type type] set,
			as described above. See
			[link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/texImage2D WebGLRenderingContext.texImage2D] for details.
