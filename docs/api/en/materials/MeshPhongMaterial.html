		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			A material for shiny surfaces with specular highlights.<br /><br />

			The material uses a non-physically based [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinn-Phong_shading_model Blinn-Phong]
			model for calculating reflectance. Unlike the Lambertian model used in the [page:MeshLambertMaterial]
			this can simulate shiny surfaces with specular highlights (such as varnished wood).<br /><br />

			Shading is calculated using a [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_shading Phong] shading model.
			This calculates shading per pixel (i.e. in the [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader#Pixel_shaders fragment shader],
			AKA pixel shader)	which gives more accurate results than the Gouraud model used by [page:MeshLambertMaterial],
			at the cost of some performance. The [page:MeshStandardMaterial] and [page:MeshPhysicalMaterial]
			also use this shading model.<br /><br />

			Performance will generally be greater when using this material over the	[page:MeshStandardMaterial]
			or [page:MeshPhysicalMaterial], at the cost of some graphical accuracy.

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:Object parameters] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Object parameters] - (optional) an object with one or more properties defining the material's appearance.
			Any property of the material (including any property inherited from [page:Material]) can be passed in here.<br /><br />

			The exception is the property [page:Hexadecimal color], which can be passed in as a hexadecimal
			string and is *0xffffff* (white) by default. [page:Color.set]( color ) is called internally.
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Material] class for common properties.</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture alphaMap]</h3>
		<p>The alpha map is a grayscale texture that controls the opacity across the surface
			(black: fully transparent; white: fully opaque). Default is null.<br /><br />

			Only the color of the texture is used, ignoring the alpha channel if one exists.
			For RGB and RGBA textures, the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer will use the
			green channel when sampling this texture due to the extra bit of precision provided
			for green in DXT-compressed and uncompressed RGB 565 formats. Luminance-only and
			luminance/alpha textures will also still work as expected.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture aoMap]</h3>
		<p>The red channel of this texture is used as the ambient occlusion map. Default is null.
		The aoMap requires a second set of UVs.</p>

		<h3>[property:Float aoMapIntensity]</h3>
		<p>Intensity of the ambient occlusion effect. Default is 1. Zero is no occlusion effect.</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture bumpMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The texture to create a bump map. The black and white values map to the perceived depth in relation to the lights.
			Bump doesn't actually affect the geometry of the object, only the lighting. If a normal map is defined this will
			be ignored.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float bumpScale]</h3>
		<p>How much the bump map affects the material. Typical ranges are 0-1. Default is 1.</p>


		<h3>[property:Color color]</h3>
		<p>[page:Color] of the material, by default set to white (0xffffff).</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer combine]</h3>
		<p>
			How to combine the result of the surface's color with the environment map, if any.<br /><br />

			Options are [page:Materials THREE.Multiply] (default), [page:Materials THREE.MixOperation],
			[page:Materials THREE.AddOperation]. If mix is chosen, the [page:.reflectivity] is used to
			blend between the two colors.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture displacementMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The displacement map affects the position of the mesh's vertices. Unlike other maps
			which only affect the light and shade of the material the displaced vertices can cast shadows,
			block other objects, and otherwise act as real geometry. The displacement texture is
			an image where the value of each pixel (white being the highest) is mapped against,
			and repositions, the vertices of the mesh.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float displacementScale]</h3>
		<p>
			How much the displacement map affects the mesh (where black is no displacement,
			and white is maximum displacement). Without a displacement map set, this value is not applied.
			 Default is 1.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float displacementBias]</h3>
		<p>
			The offset of the displacement map's values on the mesh's vertices.
			Without a displacement map set, this value is not applied. Default is 0.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Color emissive]</h3>
		<p>
		Emissive (light) color of the material, essentially a solid color unaffected by other lighting.
		Default is black.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture emissiveMap]</h3>
		<p>
		Set emisssive (glow) map. Default is null. The emissive map color is modulated by
		the emissive color and the emissive intensity. If you have an emissive map, be sure to
		set the emissive color to something other than black.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float emissiveIntensity]</h3>
		<p>Intensity of the emissive light. Modulates the emissive color. Default is 1.</p>

		<h3>[property:TextureCube envMap]</h3>
		<p>The environment map. Default is null.</p>


		<h3>[property:Texture lightMap]</h3>
		<p>The light map. Default is null. The lightMap requires a second set of UVs.</p>

		<h3>[property:Float lightMapIntensity]</h3>
		<p>Intensity of the baked light. Default is 1.</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture map]</h3>
		<p>The color map. Default is null. The texture map color is modulated by the diffuse [page:.color].</p>

		<h3>[property:boolean morphNormals]</h3>
		<p>
			Defines whether the material uses morphNormals. Set as true to pass morphNormal
			attributes from the [page:Geometry]	to the shader. Default is *false*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean morphTargets]</h3>
		<p>Define whether the material uses morphTargets. Default is false.</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture normalMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The texture to create a normal map. The RGB values affect the surface normal for each pixel fragment and change
			the way the color is lit. Normal maps do not change the actual shape of the surface, only the lighting.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer normalMapType]</h3>
		<p>
			The type of normal map.<br /><br />

			Options are [page:constant THREE.TangentSpaceNormalMap] (default), and [page:constant THREE.ObjectSpaceNormalMap].
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Vector2 normalScale]</h3>
		<p>
			How much the normal map affects the material. Typical ranges are 0-1.
			Default is a [page:Vector2] set to (1,1).
		</p>


		<h3>[property:Float reflectivity]</h3>
		<p>
			How much the environment map affects the surface; also see [page:.combine].
			The default value is 1 and the valid range is between 0 (no reflections) and 1 (full reflections).
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float refractionRatio]</h3>
		<p>
			The index of refraction (IOR) of air (approximately 1) divided by the index of refraction of the material.
			It is used with environment mapping modes [page:Textures THREE.CubeRefractionMapping] and [page:Textures THREE.EquirectangularRefractionMapping].
			The refraction ratio should not exceed 1. Default is *0.98*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float shininess]</h3>
		<p>How shiny the [page:.specular] highlight is; a higher value gives a sharper highlight. Default is *30*.</p>


		<h3>[property:Boolean skinning]</h3>
		<p>Define whether the material uses skinning. Default is false.</p>

		<h3>[property:Color specular]</h3>
		<p>
			Specular color of the material. Default is a [page:Color] set to *0x111111* (very dark grey).<br /><br />

			This defines how shiny the material is and the color of its shine.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture specularMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The specular map value affects both how much the specular surface highlight
			contributes and how much of the environment map affects the surface. Default is null.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean wireframe]</h3>
		<p>Render geometry as wireframe. Default is *false* (i.e. render as flat polygons).</p>

		<h3>[property:String wireframeLinecap]</h3>
		<p>
			Define appearance of line ends. Possible values are "butt", "round" and "square". Default is 'round'.<br /><br />

			This corresponds to the [link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineCap 2D Canvas lineCap]
			property and it is ignored by the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:String wireframeLinejoin]</h3>
		<p>
			Define appearance of line joints. Possible values are "round", "bevel" and "miter". Default is 'round'.<br /><br />

			This corresponds to the [link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineJoin 2D Canvas lineJoin]
			property and it is ignored by the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float wireframeLinewidth]</h3>
		<p>Controls wireframe thickness. Default is 1.<br /><br />

		Due to limitations of the [link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.core.pdf OpenGL Core Profile]
		with the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer on most platforms linewidth will
		always be 1 regardless of the set value.
