		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			An extension of the [page:MeshStandardMaterial], providing more advanced physically-based rendering properties:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Clearcoat:</b> Some materials — like car paints, carbon fiber, and wet surfaces — require a
				clear, reflective layer on top of another layer that may be irregular or rough. Clearcoat
				approximates this effect, without the need for a separate transparent surface.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Physically-based transparency:</b> One limitation of [page:Material.opacity .opacity] is
				that highly transparent materials are less reflective. Physically-based [page:.transmission]
				provides a more realistic option for thin, transparent surfaces like glass.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Advanced reflectivity:</b> More flexible reflectivity for non-metallic materials.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			As a result of these complex shading features, MeshPhysicalMaterial has a higher performance
			cost, per pixel, than other three.js materials. Most effects are disabled by default, and add
			cost as they are enabled. For best results, always specify an [page:.envMap environment map]
			when using this material.

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:Object parameters] )</h3>
		<p>
		[page:Object parameters] - (optional) an object with one or more properties defining the material's appearance.
		Any property of the material (including any property inherited from [page:Material] and [page:MeshStandardMaterial]) can be passed in here.<br /><br />

		The exception is the property [page:Hexadecimal color], which can be passed in as a hexadecimal
		string and is `0xffffff` (white) by default. [page:Color.set]( color ) is called internally.
		</p>


		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Material] and [page:MeshStandardMaterial] classes for common properties.</p>

		<h3>[property:Color attenuationColor]</h3>
		<p>
		The color that white light turns into due to absorption when reaching the attenuation distance. Default is `white` (0xffffff).
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float attenuationDistance]</h3>
		<p>
		Density of the medium given as the average distance that light travels in the medium before interacting with a particle. The value is given in world space. Default is `0`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float clearcoat]</h3>
		<p>
		Represents the intensity of the clear coat layer, from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use clear coat related properties to enable multilayer
		materials that have a thin translucent layer over the base layer. Default is `0.0`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture clearcoatMap]</h3>
		<p>
		The red channel of this texture is multiplied against [page:.clearcoat], for per-pixel control
		over a coating's intensity. Default is `null`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture clearcoatNormalMap]</h3>
		<p>Can be used to enable independent normals for the clear coat layer. Default is `null`.</p>

		<h3>[property:Vector2 clearcoatNormalScale]</h3>
		<p>How much [page:.clearcoatNormalMap] affects the clear coat layer, from `(0,0)` to `(1,1)`. Default is `(1,1)`.</p>

		<h3>[property:Float clearcoatRoughness]</h3>
		<p>Roughness of the clear coat layer, from `0.0` to `1.0`. Default is `0.0`.</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture clearcoatRoughnessMap]</h3>
		<p>
		The green channel of this texture is multiplied against [page:.clearcoatRoughness], for per-pixel control
		over a coating's roughness. Default is `null`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Object defines]</h3>
		<p>An object of the form:
			<code>
				{

					'STANDARD': ''
					'PHYSICAL': '',

				};
			</code>

			This is used by the [page:WebGLRenderer] for selecting shaders.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float ior]</h3>
		<p>
			Index-of-refraction for non-metallic materials, from `1.0` to `2.333`. Default is `1.5`.<br />
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float reflectivity]</h3>
		<p>
			Degree of reflectivity, from `0.0` to `1.0`. Default is `0.5`, which corresponds to an index-of-refraction of 1.5.<br />

			This models the reflectivity of non-metallic materials. It has no effect when [page:MeshStandardMaterial.metalness metalness] is `1.0`
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float sheen]</h3>
		<p>
			The intensity of the sheen layer, from `0.0` to `1.0`. Default is `0.0`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float sheenRoughness]</h3>
		<p>
			Roughness of the sheen layer, from `0.0` to `1.0`. Default is `1.0`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture sheenRoughnessMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The alpha channel of this texture is multiplied against [page:.sheenRoughness], for per-pixel control
			over sheen roughness. Default is `null`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Color sheenColor]</h3>
		<p>
			The sheen tint. Default is `0xffffff`, white.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture sheenColorMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The RGB channels of this texture are multiplied against [page:.sheenColor], for per-pixel control
			over sheen tint. Default is `null`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float specularIntensity]</h3>
		<p>
			A float that scales the amount of specular reflection for non-metals only. When set to zero, the model is effectively Lambertian. From `0.0` to `1.0`. Default is `0.0`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture specularIntensityMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The alpha channel of this texture is multiplied against [page:.specularIntensity], for per-pixel control over specular intensity. Default is `null`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Color specularColor]</h3>
		<p>
			A [page:Color] that tints the specular reflection at normal incidence for non-metals only.
			Default is `0xffffff`, white.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture specularColorMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The RGB channels of this texture are multiplied against [page:.specularColor], for per-pixel control over specular color. Default is `null`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float thickness]</h3>
		<p>
		The thickness of the volume beneath the surface. The value is given in the coordinate space of the mesh. If the value is 0 the material is thin-walled. Otherwise the material is a volume boundary. Default is `0`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture thicknessMap]</h3>
		<p>
		A texture that defines the thickness, stored in the G channel. This will be multiplied by [page:.thickness]. Default is `null`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float transmission]</h3>
		<p>
		Degree of transmission (or optical transparency), from `0.0` to `1.0`. Default is `0.0`.<br />

		Thin, transparent or semitransparent, plastic or glass materials remain largely reflective even if they are fully transmissive.

		The transmission property can be used to model these materials.<br />

		When transmission is non-zero, [page:Material.opacity opacity] should be set to `0`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture transmissionMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The red channel of this texture is multiplied against [page:.transmission], for per-pixel control
			over optical transparency. Default is `null`.
		</p>
