		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			An extension of the [page:MeshStandardMaterial], providing more advanced
			physically-based rendering properties:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Anisotropy:</b> Ability to represent the anisotropic property of materials 
				as observable with brushed metals.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Clearcoat:</b> Some materials — like car paints, carbon fiber, and
				wet surfaces — require a clear, reflective layer on top of another layer
				that may be irregular or rough. Clearcoat approximates this effect,
				without the need for a separate transparent surface.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Iridescence:</b> Allows to render the effect where hue varies 
				depending on the viewing angle and illumination angle. This can be seen on
				soap bubbles, oil films, or on the wings of many insects.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Physically-based transparency:</b> One limitation of
				[page:Material.opacity .opacity] is that highly transparent materials
				are less reflective. Physically-based [page:.transmission] provides a
				more realistic option for thin, transparent surfaces like glass.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Advanced reflectivity:</b> More flexible reflectivity for
				non-metallic materials.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Sheen:</b> Can be used for representing cloth and fabric materials.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			As a result of these complex shading features, MeshPhysicalMaterial has a
			higher performance cost, per pixel, than other three.js materials. Most
			effects are disabled by default, and add cost as they are enabled. For
			best results, always specify an [page:.envMap environment map] when using
			this material.

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:Object parameters] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Object parameters] - (optional) an object with one or more
			properties defining the material's appearance. Any property of the
			material (including any property inherited from [page:Material] and
			[page:MeshStandardMaterial]) can be passed in here.<br /><br />

			The exception is the property [page:Hexadecimal color], which can be
			passed in as a hexadecimal string and is `0xffffff` (white) by default.
			[page:Color.set]( color ) is called internally.
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<p>
			See the base [page:Material] and [page:MeshStandardMaterial] classes for
			common properties.

			bitangent space, to be rotated by [page:.anisotropyRotation]. The blue channel

		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float anisotropyRotation]</h3>
		<p>
			The rotation of the anisotropy in tangent, bitangent space, measured in radians
			counter-clockwise from the tangent. When [page:.anisotropyMap] is present, this

			The color that white light turns into due to absorption when reaching the
			attenuation distance. Default is `white` (0xffffff).
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float attenuationDistance]</h3>
		<p>
			Density of the medium given as the average distance that light travels in
			the medium before interacting with a particle. The value is given in world
			space units, and must be greater than zero. Default is `Infinity`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float clearcoat]</h3>
		<p>

			thin translucent layer over the base layer. Default is `0.0`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture clearcoatMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The red channel of this texture is multiplied against [page:.clearcoat],
			for per-pixel control over a coating's intensity. Default is `null`.
		</p>

			</code>

			This is used by the [page:WebGLRenderer] for selecting shaders.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float dispersion]</h3>
		<p>
			Defines the strength of the angular separation of colors (chromatic aberration) transmitting through a relatively clear volume.
			Any value zero or larger is valid, the typical range of realistic values is `[0, 1]`.

		<p>
			Degree of reflectivity, from `0.0` to `1.0`. Default is `0.5`, which
			corresponds to an index-of-refraction of 1.5.<br />

			when [page:MeshStandardMaterial.metalness metalness] is `1.0`
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float iridescence]</h3>

			Default is `1.3`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array iridescenceThicknessRange]</h3>
		<p>
			Array of exactly 2 elements, specifying minimum and maximum thickness of the iridescence layer.
			Thickness of iridescence layer has an equivalent effect of the one [page:.thickness] has on [page:.ior].
			Default is `[100, 400]`.<br />

			If [page:.iridescenceThicknessMap] is not defined, iridescence thickness will use only the second element of the given array.

			Minimum and maximum values of thickness are defined by [page:.iridescenceThicknessRange] array:<br/>
			<ul>
				<li>`0.0` in the green channel will result in thickness equal to first element of the array.</li>
				<li>`1.0` in the green channel will result in thickness equal to second element of the array.</li>
				<li>Values in-between will linearly interpolate between the elements of the array.</li>
			</ul>
			Default is `null`.

		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float thickness]</h3>
		<p>
			The thickness of the volume beneath the surface. The value is given in the
			coordinate space of the mesh. If the value is `0` the material is
			thin-walled. Otherwise the material is a volume boundary. Default is `0`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture thicknessMap]</h3>
		<p>
			A texture that defines the thickness, stored in the green channel. This will
			be multiplied by [page:.thickness]. Default is `null`.

		<p>
			Degree of transmission (or optical transparency), from `0.0` to `1.0`.
			Default is `0.0`.<br />

			Thin, transparent or semitransparent, plastic or glass materials remain
			largely reflective even if they are fully transmissive. The transmission
			property can be used to model these materials.<br />

			When transmission is non-zero, [page:Material.opacity opacity] should be
			set to `1`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture transmissionMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The red channel of this texture is multiplied against
			[page:.transmission], for per-pixel control over optical transparency.
