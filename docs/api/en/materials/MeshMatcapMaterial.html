		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			[name] is defined by a MatCap (or Lit Sphere) texture, which encodes the
			material color and shading.<br /><br />
			[name] does not respond to lights since the matcap image file encodes
			baked lighting. It will cast a shadow onto an object that receives shadows
			(and shadow clipping works), but it will not self-shadow or receive
			shadows.

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:Object parameters] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Object parameters] - (optional) an object with one or more
			properties defining the material's appearance. Any property of the
			material (including any property inherited from [page:Material]) can be
			passed in here.<br /><br />

			The exception is the property [page:Hexadecimal color], which can be
			passed in as a hexadecimal string and is `0xffffff` (white) by default.
			[page:Color.set]( color ) is called internally.
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Material] class for common properties.</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture alphaMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The alpha map is a grayscale texture that controls the opacity across the
			surface (black: fully transparent; white: fully opaque). Default is
			null.<br /><br />

			Only the color of the texture is used, ignoring the alpha channel if one
			exists. For RGB and RGBA textures, the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer
			will use the green channel when sampling this texture due to the extra bit
			of precision provided for green in DXT-compressed and uncompressed RGB 565
			formats. Luminance-only and luminance/alpha textures will also still work
			as expected.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture bumpMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The texture to create a bump map. The black and white values map to the
			perceived depth in relation to the lights. Bump doesn't actually affect
			the geometry of the object, only the lighting. If a normal map is defined
			this will be ignored.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float bumpScale]</h3>
		<p>
			How much the bump map affects the material. Typical ranges are 0-1.
			Default is `1`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Color color]</h3>
		<p>[page:Color] of the material, by default set to white (0xffffff).</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture displacementMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The displacement map affects the position of the mesh's vertices. Unlike
			other maps which only affect the light and shade of the material the
			displaced vertices can cast shadows, block other objects, and otherwise
			act as real geometry. The displacement texture is an image where the value
			of each pixel (white being the highest) is mapped against, and
			repositions, the vertices of the mesh.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float displacementScale]</h3>
		<p>
			How much the displacement map affects the mesh (where black is no
			displacement, and white is maximum displacement). Without a displacement
			map set, this value is not applied. Default is `1`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float displacementBias]</h3>
		<p>
			The offset of the displacement map's values on the mesh's vertices.
			The bias is added to the scaled sample of the displacement map.
			Without a displacement map set, this value is not applied. Default is `0`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean flatShading]</h3>
		<p>
			Define whether the material is rendered with flat shading. Default is
			false.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean fog]</h3>
		<p>Whether the material is affected by fog. Default is `true`.</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture map]</h3>
		<p>
			The color map. May optionally include an alpha channel, typically combined
			with [page:Material.transparent .transparent] or [page:Material.alphaTest .alphaTest].
			Default is null. The texture map color is modulated by the
			diffuse [page:.color].
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture matcap]</h3>
		<p>The matcap map. Default is null.</p>

		<h3>[property:Texture normalMap]</h3>
		<p>
			The texture to create a normal map. The RGB values affect the surface
			normal for each pixel fragment and change the way the color is lit. Normal
			maps do not change the actual shape of the surface, only the lighting. In
			case the material has a normal map authored using the left handed
			convention, the y component of normalScale should be negated to compensate
			for the different handedness.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer normalMapType]</h3>
		<p>
			The type of normal map.<br /><br />

			Options are [page:constant THREE.TangentSpaceNormalMap] (default), and
			[page:constant THREE.ObjectSpaceNormalMap].
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Vector2 normalScale]</h3>
		<p>
			How much the normal map affects the material. Typical ranges are 0-1.
			Default is a [page:Vector2] set to (1,1).
