		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
		Abstract base class for materials.<br /><br />

		Materials describe the appearance of [page:Object objects].
		They are defined in a (mostly) renderer-independent way, so you don't have to
		rewrite materials if you decide to use a different renderer.<br /><br />

		The following properties and methods are inherited by all other material types
		(although they may have different defaults).
		</p>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]()</h3>
		<p>This creates a generic material.</p>


		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<p>
		Blending destination. Default is [page:CustomBlendingEquation OneMinusSrcAlphaFactor].
		See the destination factors [page:CustomBlendingEquation constants] for all possible values.<br />
		The material's [page:Constant blending] must be set to [page:Materials CustomBlending] for this to have any effect.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer blendDstAlpha]</h3>

		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer blendEquationAlpha]</h3>
		<p>The tranparency of the [page:.blendEquation]. Default is *null*.</p>

		<h3>[property:Blending blending]</h3>
		<p>
		Which blending to use when displaying objects with this material. <br />

		<p>
		Blending source. Default is [page:CustomBlendingEquation SrcAlphaFactor].
		See the source factors [page:CustomBlendingEquation constants] for all possible values.<br />
		The material's [page:Constant blending] must be set to [page:Materials CustomBlending] for this to have any effect.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer blendSrcAlpha]</h3>
		<p>The tranparency of the [page:.blendSrc]. Default is *null*.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean clipIntersection]</h3>
		<p>
		Changes the behavior of clipping planes so that only their intersection is clipped, rather than their union.
		Default is *false*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array clippingPlanes]</h3>
		<p>
		User-defined clipping planes specified as THREE.Plane objects in world space.
		These planes apply to the objects this material is attached to.
		Points in space whose signed distance to the plane is negative are clipped (not rendered).

		</p>

		<h3>[property:Object defines]</h3>
		<p>
		Custom defines to be injected into the shader. These are passed in form of an object literal, with key/value pairs. { MY_CUSTOM_DEFINE: '' , PI2: Math.PI * 2 }. The pairs are defined in both vertex and fragment shaders.  Default is *undefined*.

		<h3>[property:Integer id]</h3>
		<p>Unique number for this material instance.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isMaterial]</h3>
		<p>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are materials. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean lights]</h3>
		<p>Whether the material is affected by lights. Default is *true*.</p>

		<h3>[property:String name]</h3>
		<p>Optional name of the object (doesn't need to be unique). Default is an empty string.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean needsUpdate]</h3>

		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float opacity]</h3>
		<p>
		Float in the range of *0.0* - *1.0* indicating how transparent the material is.
		A value of *0.0* indicates fully transparent, *1.0* is fully opaque.<br />

		fully opaque and this value will only affect its color. <br />
		Default is *1.0*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean polygonOffset]</h3>
		<p>
		Whether to use polygon offset. Default is *false*. This corresponds to the *GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL* WebGL feature.

		Defines which side of faces cast shadows.
		When set, can be [page:Materials THREE.FrontSide], [page:Materials THREE.BackSide], or [page:Materials THREE.DoubleSide]. Default is *null*. <br />
		If *null*, the side casting shadows is determined as follows: <br />

		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>[page:Material.side]</th>
					<th>Side casting shadows</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>

				<tr>
					<td>THREE.FrontSide</td>
					<td>back side</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>THREE.BackSide</td>
					<td>front side</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>THREE.DoubleSide</td>
					<td>both sides</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>


		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer side]</h3>
		<p>
		Defines which side of faces will be rendered - front, back or both.

		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean transparent]</h3>
		<p>
		Defines whether this material is transparent. This has an effect on rendering
		as transparent objects need special treatment and are rendered after
		non-transparent objects. <br />
		When set to true, the extent to which the material is transparent is
		controlled by setting its [page:Float opacity] property. <br />
		Default is *false*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:String type]</h3>
		<p>
		Value is the string 'Material'. This shouldn't be changed, and can be used to
		find all objects of this type in a scene.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:String uuid]</h3>
		<p>
		[link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier UUID] of this material instance.
		This gets automatically assigned, so this shouldn't be edited.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer vertexColors]</h3>
		<p>
		Defines whether vertex coloring is used.
		Default is [page:Materials THREE.NoColors].
		Other options are [page:Materials THREE.VertexColors] and [page:Materials THREE.FaceColors].
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean vertexTangents]</h3>
		<p>
		Defines whether precomputed vertex tangents, which must be provided in a vec4 "tangent" attribute,
		are used. When disabled, tangents are derived automatically. Using precomputed tangents will give
		more accurate normal map details in some cases, such as with mirrored UVs. Default is false.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean visible]</h3>
		<p>
		Defines whether this material is visible. Default is *true*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:object userData]</h3>
		<p>
		An object that can be used to store custom data about the Material. It should not hold
		references to functions as these will not be cloned.
		</p>
