		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
		Creates a texture for use with a video texture.<br /><br />

		This is almost the same as the base [page:Texture Texture] class, except that it continuosly sets [page:Texture.needsUpdate needsUpdate] to *true* so that the texture is updated as the video plays. Automatic creation of [page:Texture.mipmaps mipmaps] is also disabled.
		</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>

		<p>[example:webgl_materials_video materials / video ]</p>

		<code>
//assuming you have created a HTML video element with id="video"
var video = document.getElementById( 'video' );

var texture = new THREE.VideoTexture( video );
texture.minFilter = THREE.LinearFilter;
texture.magFilter = THREE.LinearFilter;
texture.format = THREE.RGBFormat;
    </code>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>
		<h3>[name]( [param:Video video], [param:Constant mapping], [param:Constant wrapS], [param:Constant wrapT], [param:Constant magFilter], [param:Constant minFilter], [param:Constant format], [param:Constant type], [param:Number anisotropy] )</h3>
		<p>
		[page:Video video] -- The video element to use as the texture. <br />

		[page:Constant mapping] --  How the image is applied to the object. An object type of [page:Textures THREE.UVMapping].
		See [page:Textures mapping constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant wrapS] -- The default is [page:Textures THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping].
		See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant wrapT] -- The default is [page:Textures THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping].
		See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant magFilter] -- How the texture is sampled when a texel covers more than one pixel.
		The default is [page:Textures THREE.LinearFilter]. See [page:Textures magnification filter constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant minFilter] -- How the texture is sampled when a texel covers less than one pixel.
		 The default is [page:Textures THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter]. See [page:Textures minification filter constants] for other choices.<br />

    [page:Constant format] -- The format used in the texture.
     See [page:Textures format constants] for other choices.<br />

    [page:Constant type] -- Default is [page:Textures THREE.UnsignedByteType].
     See [page:Textures type constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Number anisotropy] -- The number of samples taken along the axis through the pixel that has the highest density of texels.
		By default, this value is 1. A higher value gives a less blurry result than a basic mipmap, at the cost of more texture samples being used.
		Use [page:WebGLrenderer.getMaxAnisotropy renderer.getMaxAnisotropy]() to find the maximum valid anisotropy value for the GPU; this value is usually a power of 2.<br /><br />
		</p>


		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<p>
    See the base [page:Texture Texture] class for common properties.
    </p>

		<h3>[property:boolean needsUpdate]</h3>
		<p>
		You will not need to set this manually here as it is handled by the [page:VideoTexture.update update] method.
		</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

    <p>
    See the base [page:Texture Texture] class for common methods.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:null update]()</h3>
		<p>
		This is called automatically and sets [property:boolean needsUpdate] to *true* every time
    a new frame is available.
		</p>
