		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
		Creates a texture from a canvas element.<br /><br />

		This is almost the same as the base [page:Texture Texture] class, except that it sets [page:Texture.needsUpdate needsUpdate] to *true* immediately.
		</p>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>
		<h3>[name]( [param:HTMLElement canvas], [param:Constant mapping], [param:Constant wrapS], [param:Constant wrapT], [param:Constant magFilter], [param:Constant minFilter], [param:Constant format], [param:Constant type], [param:Number anisotropy] )</h3>
		<p>
		[page:HTMLElement canvas] -- The HTML canvas element from which to load the texture. <br />

		[page:Constant mapping] --  How the image is applied to the object. An object type of [page:Textures THREE.UVMapping].
		See [page:Textures mapping constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant wrapS] -- The default is [page:Textures THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping].
		See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant wrapT] -- The default is [page:Textures THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping].
		See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant magFilter] -- How the texture is sampled when a texel covers more than one pixel.
		The default is [page:Textures THREE.LinearFilter]. See [page:Textures magnification filter constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant minFilter] -- How the texture is sampled when a texel covers less than one pixel.
		 The default is [page:Textures THREE.LinearMipMapLinearFilter]. See [page:Textures minification filter constants] for other choices.<br />

    [page:Constant format] -- The format used in the texture.
     See [page:Textures format constants] for other choices.<br />

    [page:Constant type] -- Default is [page:Textures THREE.UnsignedByteType].
     See [page:Textures type constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Number anisotropy] -- The number of samples taken along the axis through the pixel that has the highest density of texels.
		By default, this value is 1. A higher value gives a less blurry result than a basic mipmap, at the cost of more texture samples being used.
		Use [page:WebGLrenderer.getMaxAnisotropy renderer.getMaxAnisotropy]() to find the maximum valid anisotropy value for the GPU; this value is usually a power of 2.<br /><br />

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<p>
    See the base [page:Texture Texture] class for common properties.
    </p>

		<h3>[property:boolean needsUpdate]</h3>

		<p>
			True by default. This is required so that the canvas data is loaded.
		</p>
