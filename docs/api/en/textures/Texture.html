		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">Create a texture to apply to a surface or as a reflection or refraction map.</p>

		<h2>Code Example</h2>

		<code>
		// load a texture, set wrap mode to repeat
		const texture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load( "textures/water.jpg" );
		texture.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
		texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
		texture.repeat.set( 4, 4 );
		</code>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( image, mapping, wrapS, wrapT, magFilter, minFilter, format, type, anisotropy, encoding )</h3>

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>[property:Integer id]</h3>
		<p>
		Readonly - unique number for this texture instance.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:String uuid]</h3>
		<p>
		[link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier UUID] of this object instance.
		This gets automatically assigned, so this shouldn't be edited.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:String name]</h3>
		<p>
		Optional name of the object (doesn't need to be unique). Default is an empty string.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Image image]</h3>
		<p>
		An image object, typically created using the [page:TextureLoader.load] method.
		This can be any image (e.g., PNG, JPG, GIF, DDS) or video (e.g., MP4, OGG/OGV) type supported by three.js.<br /><br />

		To use video as a texture you need to have a playing HTML5
		video element as a source for your texture image and continuously update this texture
		as long as video is playing - the [page:VideoTexture VideoTexture] class handles this automatically.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Array mipmaps]</h3>
		<p>
		Array of user-specified mipmaps (optional).
		</p>

		<h3>[property:number mapping]</h3>
		<p>
		How the image is applied to the object. An object type of [page:Textures THREE.UVMapping] is the default,
		where the U,V coordinates are used to apply the map.<br />

		See the [page:Textures texture constants] page for other mapping types.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:number wrapS]</h3>
		<p>
		This defines how the texture is wrapped horizontally and corresponds to *U* in UV mapping.<br />
		The default is [page:Textures THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping], where the edge is clamped to the outer edge texels.
		The other two choices are [page:Textures THREE.RepeatWrapping] and [page:Textures THREE.MirroredRepeatWrapping].
		See the [page:Textures texture constants] page for details.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:number wrapT]</h3>
		<p>
		This defines how the texture is wrapped vertically and corresponds to *V* in UV mapping.<br />
		The same choices are available as for [property:number wrapS].<br /><br />

		NOTE: tiling of images in textures only functions if image dimensions are powers of two
		 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, ...) in terms of pixels.
		 Individual dimensions need not be equal, but each must be a power of two.
		 This is a limitation of WebGL, not three.js.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:number magFilter]</h3>
		<p>
		How the texture is sampled when a texel covers more than one pixel. The default is
		 [page:Textures THREE.LinearFilter], which takes the four closest texels and bilinearly interpolates among them.
		 The other option is [page:Textures THREE.NearestFilter], which uses the value of the closest texel.<br />
		 See the [page:Textures texture constants] page for details.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:number minFilter]</h3>
		<p>
		How the texture is sampled when a texel covers less than one pixel. The default is
		[page:Textures THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter], which uses mipmapping and a trilinear filter. <br /><br />

		See the [page:Textures texture constants] page for all possible choices.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:number anisotropy]</h3>
		<p>
		The number of samples taken along the axis through the pixel that has the highest density of texels.
		By default, this value is 1. A higher value gives a less blurry result than a basic mipmap,
		at the cost of more texture samples being used. Use [page:WebGLRenderer.getMaxAnisotropy renderer.getMaxAnisotropy]() to
		find the maximum valid anisotropy value for the GPU; this value is usually a power of 2.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:number format]</h3>
		<p>
		The default is [page:Textures THREE.RGBAFormat], although the [page:TextureLoader TextureLoader] will automatically
		set this to [page:Textures THREE.RGBFormat] for JPG images. <br /><br />

		See the [page:Textures texture constants] page for details of other formats.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:String internalFormat]</h3>
		<p>
		The default value is obtained using a combination of [page:Texture.format .format] and
		[page:Texture.type .type].<br />

		The GPU format allows the developer to specify how the data is going to be
		stored on the GPU.<br /><br />

		See the [page:Textures texture constants] page for details regarding all supported internal formats.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:number type]</h3>
		<p>
		This must correspond to the [page:Texture.format .format]. The default is [page:Textures THREE.UnsignedByteType],
		which will be used for most texture formats.<br /><br />

		See the [page:Textures texture constants] page for details of other formats.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Vector2 offset]</h3>
		<p>
		How much a single repetition of the texture is offset from the beginning, in each direction U and V.
		Typical range is *0.0* to *1.0*.  _Note:_ The offset property is a convenience modifier and only affects
		the Texture's application to the first set of UVs on a model.  If the Texture is used as a map requiring
		additional UV sets (e.g. the aoMap or lightMap of most stock materials), those UVs must be manually
		assigned to achieve the desired offset.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Vector2 repeat]</h3>
		<p>
		How many times the texture is repeated across the surface, in each direction U and V.  If repeat is set
		greater than 1 in either direction, the corresponding Wrap parameter should also be set to
		[page:Textures THREE.RepeatWrapping] or [page:Textures THREE.MirroredRepeatWrapping] to achieve the desired
		tiling effect.  _Note:_ The repeat property is a convenience modifier and only affects
		the Texture's application to the first set of UVs on a model.  If the Texture is used as a map requiring
		additional UV sets (e.g. the aoMap or lightMap of most stock materials), those UVs must be manually
		assigned to achieve the desired repetiton.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:number rotation]</h3>
		<p>
		How much the texture is rotated around the center point, in radians. Positive values are counter-clockwise. Default is *0*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Vector2 center]</h3>
		<p>
		The point around which rotation occurs. A value of (0.5, 0.5) corresponds to the center of the texture. Default is (0, 0), the lower left.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean matrixAutoUpdate]</h3>
		<p>
		Whether to update the texture's uv-transform [page:Texture.matrix .matrix] from the texture properties [page:Texture.offset .offset], [page:Texture.repeat .repeat],
		[page:Texture.rotation .rotation], and [page:Texture.center .center]. True by default.
		Set this to false if you are specifying the uv-transform matrix directly.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Matrix3 matrix]</h3>
		<p>
		The uv-transform matrix for the texture. Updated by the renderer from the texture properties [page:Texture.offset .offset], [page:Texture.repeat .repeat],
		[page:Texture.rotation .rotation], and [page:Texture.center .center] when the texture's [page:Texture.matrixAutoUpdate .matrixAutoUpdate] property is true.
		When [page:Texture.matrixAutoUpdate .matrixAutoUpdate] property is false, this matrix may be set manually.
		Default is the identity matrix.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean generateMipmaps]</h3>
		<p>
		Whether to generate mipmaps (if possible) for a texture. True by default. Set this to false if you are
		creating mipmaps manually.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean premultiplyAlpha]</h3>
		<p>
		If set to *true*, the alpha channel, if present, is multiplied into the color channels when the texture is uploaded to the GPU. Default is *false*.<br /><br />

		Note that this property has no effect for [link:https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/ImageBitmap ImageBitmap].
		You need to configure on bitmap creation instead. See [page:ImageBitmapLoader].
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean flipY]</h3>
		<p>
		If set to *true*, the texture is flipped along the vertical axis when uploaded to the GPU. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

		Note that this property has no effect for [link:https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/ImageBitmap ImageBitmap].
		You need to configure on bitmap creation instead. See [page:ImageBitmapLoader].
		</p>

		<h3>[property:number unpackAlignment]</h3>
		<p>
		4 by default. Specifies the alignment requirements for the start of each pixel row in memory.
		The allowable values are 1 (byte-alignment), 2 (rows aligned to even-numbered bytes),
		4 (word-alignment), and 8 (rows start on double-word boundaries).
		See [link:http://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glPixelStorei.xml glPixelStorei]
		for more information.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:number encoding]</h3>
		<p>
		[page:Textures THREE.LinearEncoding] is the default.
		See the [page:Textures texture constants] page for details of other formats.<br /><br />

		Note that if this value is changed on a texture after the material has been used,
		it is necessary to trigger a Material.needsUpdate for this value to be realized in the shader.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer version]</h3>
		<p>
		This starts at *0* and counts how many times [property:Boolean needsUpdate] is set to *true*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Function onUpdate]</h3>
		<p>
		A callback function, called when the texture is updated (e.g., when needsUpdate has been set to true
		and then the texture is used).
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean needsUpdate]</h3>
		<p>
		Set this to *true* to trigger an update next time the texture is used. Particularly important for setting the wrap mode.
		</p>
