		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			Creates a texture based on data in compressed form, for example from a
			[link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectDraw_Surface DDS] file.<br /><br />

			For use with the [page:CompressedTextureLoader CompressedTextureLoader].
		</p>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>
			[name]( [param:Array mipmaps], [param:Number width], [param:Number height], 
			[param:Constant format], [param:Constant type], [param:Constant mapping], 
			[param:Constant wrapS], [param:Constant wrapT], [param:Constant magFilter], 
			[param:Constant minFilter], [param:Number anisotropy], [param:Constant colorSpace] )
		</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Array mipmaps] -- The mipmaps array should contain objects with
			data, width and height. The mipmaps should be of the correct format and
			type.<br />

			[page:Number width] -- The width of the biggest mipmap.<br />

			[page:Number height] -- The height of the biggest mipmap.<br />

			[page:Constant format] -- The format used in the mipmaps. See
			[page:Textures ST3C Compressed Texture Formats], [page:Textures PVRTC Compressed Texture Formats] 
			and [page:Textures ETC Compressed Texture Format] for other choices.<br />

			[page:Constant type] -- Default is [page:Textures THREE.UnsignedByteType].
			See [page:Textures type constants] for other choices.<br />

			[page:Constant mapping] -- How the image is applied to the object. An
			object type of [page:Textures THREE.UVMapping]. See [page:Textures mapping constants] for other choices.<br />

			[page:Constant wrapS] -- The default is [page:Textures THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping]. 
			See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for
			other choices.<br />

			[page:Constant wrapT] -- The default is [page:Textures THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping]. 
			See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for
			other choices.<br />

			[page:Constant magFilter] -- How the texture is sampled when a texel
			covers more than one pixel. The default is [page:Textures THREE.LinearFilter]. 
			See [page:Textures magnification filter constants]
			for other choices.<br />

			[page:Constant minFilter] -- How the texture is sampled when a texel
			covers less than one pixel. The default is [page:Textures THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter]. 
			See [page:Textures minification filter constants] for other choices.<br />

			[page:Number anisotropy] -- The number of samples taken along the axis
			through the pixel that has the highest density of texels. By default, this
			value is `1`. A higher value gives a less blurry result than a basic mipmap,
			at the cost of more texture samples being used. Use
			renderer.getMaxAnisotropy() to find the maximum valid anisotropy value for
			the GPU; this value is usually a power of 2.<br />

			[page:Constant colorSpace] -- The default is [page:Textures THREE.NoColorSpace]. 
			See [page:Textures color space constants] for other
			choices.<br /><br />

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		See the base [page:Texture Texture] class for common properties.

		<h3>[property:Boolean flipY]</h3>

		<p>
			False by default. Flipping textures does not work for compressed textures.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean generateMipmaps]</h3>

		<p>False by default. Mipmaps can't be generated for compressed textures</p>

		<h3>[property:Object image]</h3>
		<p>Overridden with a object containing width and height.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isCompressedTexture]</h3>
		<p>Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].</p>
