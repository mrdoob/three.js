		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<div class="desc">Represents a spline.</div>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]( [page:Array points] )</h3>
		
		<div>Initialises the spline with *points*, which are the places through which the spline will go.</div>


		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>[property:Array points]</h3>


		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>[method:todo initFromArray]( [page:Array a] )</h3>
		<div>
		a — array of triplets containing x, y, z coordinates<br />
		</div>
		<div>Initialises using the data in the array as a series of points. Each value in *a* must be another array with three values, where a[n] is v, the value for the *nth* point, and v[0], v[1] and v[2] are the x, y and z coordinates of that point n, respectively.
		</div>

		<h3>[method:todo getPoint]( [page:Integer k] )</h3>
		<div>
		k — point index
		</div>
		<div>Return the interpolated point at *k*.</div>
		
		<h3>[method:todo getControlPointsArray]( )</h3>
		<div>Returns an array with triplets of x, y, z coordinates that correspond to the current control points.
		</div>
		
		<h3>[method:todo getLength]( [page:Integer nSubDivisions] )</h3>
		<div>
		nSubDivisions — number of subdivisions between control points. Default is *100*.
		</div>
		<div>Returns the length of the spline when using nSubDivisions.</div>
		
		<h3>[method:todo reparametrizeByArcLength]( [page:Float samplingCoef] )</h3>
		<div>
		samplingCoef — how many intermediate values to use between spline points
		</div>
		<div>Modifies the spline so that it looks similar to the original but has its points distributed in such way that moving along the spline it's done at a more or less constant speed. The points should also appear more uniformly spread along the curve.</div>
		<div>This is done by resampling the original spline, with the density of sampling controlled by *samplingCoef*. Here it's interesting to note that denser sampling is not necessarily better: if sampling is too high, you may get weird kinks in curvature.</div>
