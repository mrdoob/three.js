    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <div class="desc">A group of objects that receives a shared animation state.<br /><br />
        		
        For an overview of the different elements of the three.js animation system see the
        "Animation System" article in the "Next Steps" section of the manual.
    </div>

    <h2>Usage:</h2>

    <div class="desc">
        Add objects you would otherwise pass as 'root' to the	constructor or the [page:AnimationMixer.clipAction clipAction]
        method of [page:AnimationMixer AnimationMixer] and instead pass this object as 'root'.<br /><br />

        Note that objects of this class appear as one object to the mixer,
        so cache control of the individual objects must be done	on the group.
    </div>


    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <div class="desc">
        The animated properties must be compatible among all objects in the group.<br /><br />

        A single property can either be controlled through a target group or directly, but not both.
    </div>


    <h2>Constructor</h2>


    <h3>[name]( [page:object obj1], [page:object obj2], [page:object obj3], ... )</h3>
      [page:object obj] - an abitrary number of meshes that share the same animation state.<br />

   
    <h2>Properties</h2>
    

    <h3>[property:object stats]</h3>
    <div>
        An object that contains some informations of this *AnimationObjectGroup* (total number, number 
        in use, number of bindings per object)
    </div>    
    
    <h3>[property:String uuid]</h3>
    <div>
        The [link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier UUID] of this 
        *AnimationObjectGroup*. It gets automatically assigned and shouldn't be edited.
    </div>


    <h2>Methods</h2>


    <h3>[method:null add]( [page:object obj1], [page:object obj2], [page:object obj3], ... )</h3>
    <div>
        Adds an arbitrary number of objects to this *AnimationObjectGroup*.

    <h3>[method:null remove]( [page:object obj1], [page:object obj2], [page:object obj3], ... )</h3>
    <div>
        Removes an arbitrary number of objects from this *AnimationObjectGroup*.
    </div>
