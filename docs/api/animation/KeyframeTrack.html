		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<div class="desc">
			A KeyframeTrack is a timed sequence of [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame keyframes],
			which are composed of lists of times and related values, and which are used to animate a
			specific property of an object.<br /><br />

			For an overview of the different elements of the three.js animation system see the
			"Animation System" article in the "Next Steps" section of the manual.<br /><br />

			In contrast to the animation hierarchy of the
			[link:https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/JSON-Model-format-3 JSON model format] a
			*KeyframeTrack* doesn't store its single keyframes as objects in a "keys" array (holding the
			times and the values for each frame together in one place).<br /><br />

			Instead of this there are always two arrays in a *KeyframeTrack*: the [page:.times times] array
			stores the time values for all keyframes of this track in sequential order, and the
			[page:.values values] array contains the corresponding changing values of the animated property.<br /><br />

			A single value, belonging to a certain point of time, can not only be a simple number, but (for
			example) a vector (if a position is animated) or a quaternion (if a rotation is animated). For
			this reason the values array (which is a flat array, too) might be three or four times as long as the
			times array.<br /><br />

			Corresponding to the different possible types of animated values there are several subclasses of
			*KeyframeTrack*, inheriting the most properties and methods:

			<ul>
				<li>[page:BooleanKeyframeTrack]</li>
				<li>[page:ColorKeyframeTrack]</li>
				<li>[page:NumberKeyframeTrack]</li>
				<li>[page:QuaternionKeyframeTrack]</li>
				<li>[page:StringKeyframeTrack]</li>
				<li>[page:VectorKeyframeTrack]</li>
			</ul>
			Some examples of how to manually create [page:AnimationClip AnimationClips] with different sorts
			of KeyframeTracks can be found in the [link:https://threejs.org/examples/js/AnimationClipCreator.js]
			file.<br /><br />

			Since explicit values are only specified for the discrete points of time stored in the times array,
			all values in between have to be interpolated.<br /><br />

			The track's name is important for the connection of this track with a specific property of the
			animated node (done by [page:PropertyBinding]).


		</div>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]( [page:String name], [page:Array times], [page:Array values], [page:Constant interpolation] )</h3>
		<div>
			[page:String name] - the identifier for the *KeyframeTrack*.<br />
			[page:Array times] - an array of keyframe times, converted internally to a
			[link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array Float32Array].<br />
			[page:Array values] - an array with the values related to the times array, converted internally to a
			[link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array Float32Array].<br />
			[page:Constant interpolation] - the type of interpolation to use. See
			[page:Animation Animation Constants] for possible values. Default is [page:Animation InterpolateLinear].
		</div>


		<h2>Properties</h2>


		<h3>[property:String name]</h3>
		<div>
			The track's name can refer to [page:Geometry.morphTargets morph targets] or
			[page:SkinnedMesh bones] or possibly other values within an animated object. See
			[page:PropertyBinding.parseTrackName] for the forms of strings that can be parsed for property
			binding:<br /><br />

			The name can specify the node either using its name or its uuid (although it needs to be in the
			subtree of the scene graph node passed into the mixer). Or, if the track name starts with a dot,
			the track applies to the root node that was passed into the mixer.<br /><br />

			Usually after the node a property will be specified directly. But you can also specify a
			subproperty, such as .rotation[x], if you just want to drive the X component of the rotation
			via a float track.<br /><br />

			You can also specify bones or multimaterials by using an object name, for example:
			.bones[R_hand].scale; the red channel of the diffuse color of the fourth material in a
			materials array - as a further example - can be accessed with .materials[3].diffuse[r].<br /><br />

			PropertyBinding will also resolve morph target names, for example: .morphTargetInfluences[run].<br /><br />

			Note: The track's name does not necessarily have to be unique. Multiple tracks can drive the same
			property. The result should be based on a weighted blend between the multiple tracks according to
			the weights of their respective actions.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Float32Array times]</h3>
		<div>
			A [link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array Float32Array],

		<h3>[property:Float32Array values]</h3>
		<div>

		<h3>[property:Constant ValueBufferType ]</h3>
		<div>
			[link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array Float32Array],
