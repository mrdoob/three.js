		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			A light that gets emitted in a specific direction. This light will behave as though it is
			infinitely far away and the rays produced from it are all parallel. The common use case
			for this is to simulate daylight; the sun is far enough away that its position can be
			considered to be infinite, and all light rays coming from it are parallel.<br /><br />

			This light can cast shadows - see the [page:DirectionalLightShadow] page for details.

		<code>
		// White directional light at half intensity shining from the top.
		var directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight( 0xffffff, 0.5 );
		scene.add( directionalLight );
		</code>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:Integer color], [param:Float intensity] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Integer color] - (optional) hexadecimal color of the light. Default is 0xffffff (white).<br />
			[page:Float intensity] - (optional) numeric value of the light's strength/intensity. Default is 1.<br /><br />

			Creates a new [name].
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		See the base [page:Light Light] class for common properties.

		<h3>[property:Boolean castShadow]</h3>
		<p>
			If set to *true* light will cast dynamic shadows. *Warning*: This is expensive and
			requires tweaking to get shadows looking right. See the [page:DirectionalLightShadow] for details.
			The default is *false*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isDirectionalLight]</h3>
		<p>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are directional lights. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it is used internally for optimisation.
		</p>


		<h3>[property:Vector3 position]</h3>
		<p>
			This is set equal to [page:Object3D.DefaultUp] (0, 1, 0), so that the light shines from the top down.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:DirectionalLightShadow shadow]</h3>
		<p>
			A [page:DirectionalLightShadow] used to calculate shadows for this light.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Object3D target]</h3>
		<p>
			When target is *undefined* (the default), the DirectionalLight is directed along the positive Z axis of its local
			frame ('Free Direct Light' mode). In this mode, the direction of the DirectionalLight is thus defined
			by its [page:Object3D.quaternion quaternion] and the quaternions of its ancestors.
<code>
// set the [page:.quaternion quaternion] directly
light.quaternion.set( 1, 0, 0, 0 );
light.matrixWorldNeedsUpdate = true;

// modify the [page:.quaternion quaternion] using [page:Object3D.lookAt] on world coordinates
light.lookAt( 0, 0, 0 );

// add the light to a possibly moving [page:Object3D]
animatedGroup.add(light);
</code>

			When target is *defined*, the DirectionalLight points from its world [page:.position position]
			to the world position of its target, extracted from [page:Object3D.matrixWorld target.matrixWorld].
			This 'Target Direct Light' mode may be used to have the light track a moving object :
			<code>
var targetObject = new THREE.Object3D();
scene.add(targetObject);
light.target = targetObject;
			</code>
			*Note*: The target object mush be added to the [page:Scene scene] to get its
			[page:Object3D.matrixWorld matrixWorld] automatically updated each frame.
			Moreover, the [page:Object3D.quaternion quaternion] property is unused when the [page.target target]
			property is defined.<br/>

			*Note*: In both modes, the [page:.position position] is used by the [page:.shadow shadow] camera
			to cast shadows.
