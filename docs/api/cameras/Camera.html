		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<div class="desc">Abstract base class for cameras. This class should always be inherited when you build a new camera.</div>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]()</h3>
		<div>
			This constructor sets the following properties to the correct type:
			[page:Camera.matrixWorldInverse matrixWorldInverse] and [page:Camera.projectionMatrix projectionMatrix].

		</div>


		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<div>See the base [page:Object3D] class for common properties.</div>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isCamera]</h3>
		<div>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are cameras. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it used internally by the renderer for optimisation.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Matrix4 matrixWorldInverse]</h3>
		<div>
			This is the inverse of matrixWorld. MatrixWorld contains the Matrix which has
			the world transform of the Camera.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Matrix4 projectionMatrix]</h3>
		<div>This is the matrix which contains the projection.</div>

		<h3>[property:Layers layers]</h3>
		<div>
		The [page:Layers layers] that the camera is a member of. This is an inherited
		property from [page:Object3D].<br /><br />

		Objects must share at least one layer with the camera to be seen
		when the camera's viewpoint is rendered.
		</div>

		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<div>See the base [page:Objct3D] class for common methods.</div>

		<h3>[method:Vector3 getWorldDirection]( [page:Vector3 optionalTarget] )</h3>
		<div>
		vector — (optional)<br /><br />

		Returns a vector representing the direction in which the camera is looking,
		in world space. If the [page:Vector3 optionalTarget] is set, returns a vector representing the direction
		from the camera's position to the [page:Vector3 optionalTarget].
		</div>


		<h3>[method:null lookAt]( [page:Vector3 target] )</h3>
		<div>
		target — position in 3D space for the camera to point towards<br /><br />

		This makes the camera look at the vector position in the global space as long as
		the parent of this camera is the scene or at position (0,0,0).
		</div>

		<h3>[method:Camera clone]( [page:Camera camera] )</h3>
		<div>
		camera — camera to clone<br /><br />

		Returns a clone of camera.
		</div>
