		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<div class="desc">
		Creates a texture based on data in compressed form, for example from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectDraw_Surface">DDS</a> file.<br /><br />

		
		For use with the [page:CompressedTextureLoader CompressedTextureLoader].
		</div>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]( [page:Array mipmaps], [page:Number width], [page:Number height], [page:Constant format], [page:Constant type], [page:Constant mapping], [page:Constant wrapS], [page:Constant wrapT], [page:Constant magFilter], [page:Constant minFilter], [page:Number anisotropy] )</h3>
		<div>
		[page:Array mipmaps] -- The mipmaps array should contain objects with data, width and height. The mipmaps should be of the correct format and type.<br />

		[page:Number width] -- The width of the biggest mipmap.<br />

		[page:Number height] -- The height of the biggest mipmap.<br />

		[page:Constant format] -- The format used in the mipmaps.
		See [page:Textures ST3C Compressed Texture Formats],
		[page:Textures PVRTC Compressed Texture Formats] and
		[page:Textures ETC Compressed Texture Format] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant type] -- Default is [page:Textures THREE.UnsignedByteType].
		See [page:Textures type constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant mapping] --  How the image is applied to the object. An object type of [page:Textures THREE.UVMapping].
		See [page:Textures mapping constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant wrapS] -- The default is [page:Textures THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping].
		See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant wrapT] -- The default is [page:Textures THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping].
		See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant magFilter] -- How the texture is sampled when a texel covers more than one pixel.
		The default is [page:Textures THREE.LinearFilter]. See [page:Textures magnification filter constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant minFilter] -- How the texture is sampled when a texel covers less than one pixel.
		 The default is [page:Textures THREE.LinearMipMapLinearFilter]. See [page:Textures minification filter constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Number anisotropy] -- The number of samples taken along the axis through the pixel that has the highest density of texels.
		By default, this value is 1. A higher value gives a less blurry result than a basic mipmap, at the cost of more texture samples being used.
		Use renderer.getMaxAnisotropy() to find the maximum valid anisotropy value for the GPU; this value is usually a power of 2.<br /><br />
		</div>


		<h2>Properties</h2>

		See the base [page:Texture Texture] class for common properties.

		<h3>[property:boolean flipY]</h3>

		<div>
			False by default. Flipping textures does not work for compressed textures.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:boolean generateMipmaps]</h3>

		<div>
			False by default. Mipmaps can't be generated for compressed textures
		</div>
