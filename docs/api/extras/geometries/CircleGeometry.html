		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<div class="desc">CircleGeometry is a simple shape of Euclidean geometry.  It is contructed from a number of triangular segments that are oriented around a central point and extend as far out as a given radius.  It is built counter-clockwise from a start angle and a given central angle.  It can also be used to create regular polygons, where the number of segments determines the number of sides.
		</div>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]([page:Float radius], [page:Integer segments], [page:Float thetaStart], [page:Float thetaLength])</h3>
		<div>
		radius — Radius of the circle, default = 50.<br />
		segments — Number of segments (triangles), minimum = 3, default = 8.<br />
		thetaStart — Start angle for first segment, default = 0 (three o'clock position).<br />
		thetaLength — The central angle, often called theta, of the circular sector. The default is 2*Pi, which makes for a complete circle.
		</div>
