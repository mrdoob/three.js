		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			A polyhedron is a solid in three dimensions with flat faces. This class
			will take an array of vertices, project them onto a sphere, and then
			divide them up to the desired level of detail. This class is used by
			[page:DodecahedronGeometry], [page:IcosahedronGeometry],
			[page:OctahedronGeometry], and [page:TetrahedronGeometry] to generate
			their respective geometries.
		</p>

		<h2>Code Example</h2>
		<code>
const verticesOfCube = [
    -1,-1,-1,    1,-1,-1,    1, 1,-1,    -1, 1,-1,
    -1,-1, 1,    1,-1, 1,    1, 1, 1,    -1, 1, 1,
];

const indicesOfFaces = [
    2,1,0,    0,3,2,
    0,4,7,    7,3,0,
    0,1,5,    5,4,0,
    1,2,6,    6,5,1,
    2,3,7,    7,6,2,
    4,5,6,    6,7,4
];

const geometry = new THREE.PolyhedronGeometry( verticesOfCube, indicesOfFaces, 6, 2 );
</code>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>
			[name]([param:Array vertices], [param:Array indices], [param:Float radius], [param:Integer detail])
		</h3>
		<p>
			vertices — [page:Array] of points of the form [1,1,1, -1,-1,-1, ... ]
			<br />
			indices — [page:Array] of indices that make up the faces of the form
			[0,1,2, 2,3,0, ... ] <br />
			radius — [page:Float] - The radius of the final shape <br />
			detail — [page:Integer] - How many levels to subdivide the geometry. The
			more detail, the smoother the shape.
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:BufferGeometry] class for common properties.</p>

		<h3>[property:Object parameters]</h3>
		<p>
			An object with a property for each of the constructor parameters. Any
			modification after instantiation does not change the geometry.
		</p>
