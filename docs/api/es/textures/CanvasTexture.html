		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			Creates a texture from a canvas element.<br /><br />

			This is almost the same as the base [page:Texture Texture] class, except
			that it sets [page:Texture.needsUpdate needsUpdate] to `true` immediately.
		</p>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>
		<h3>
			[name]( [param:HTMLElement canvas], [param:Constant mapping],
			[param:Constant wrapS], [param:Constant wrapT], [param:Constant magFilter], 
			[param:Constant minFilter], [param:Constant format],
			[param:Constant type], [param:Number anisotropy] )
		</h3>
		<p>
			[page:HTMLElement canvas] -- The HTML canvas element from which to load
			the texture. <br />

			[page:Constant mapping] -- How the image is applied to the object. An
			object type of [page:Textures THREE.UVMapping]. See [page:Textures mapping constants] for other choices.<br />

			[page:Constant wrapS] -- The default is [page:Textures THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping]. 
			See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for
			other choices.<br />

			[page:Constant wrapT] -- The default is [page:Textures THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping]. 
			See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for
			other choices.<br />

			[page:Constant magFilter] -- How the texture is sampled when a texel
			covers more than one pixel. The default is [page:Textures THREE.LinearFilter]. 
			See [page:Textures magnification filter constants]
			for other choices.<br />

			[page:Constant minFilter] -- How the texture is sampled when a texel
			covers less than one pixel. The default is [page:Textures THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter]. 
			See [page:Textures minification filter constants] for other choices.<br />

			[page:Constant format] -- The format used in the texture. See
			[page:Textures format constants] for other choices.<br />

			[page:Constant type] -- Default is [page:Textures THREE.UnsignedByteType].
			See [page:Textures type constants] for other choices.<br />

			[page:Number anisotropy] -- The number of samples taken along the axis
			through the pixel that has the highest density of texels. By default, this
			value is `1`. A higher value gives a less blurry result than a basic mipmap,
			at the cost of more texture samples being used. Use
			[page:WebGLrenderer.getMaxAnisotropy renderer.getMaxAnisotropy]() to find
			the maximum valid anisotropy value for the GPU; this value is usually a
			power of 2.<br /><br />

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<p>See the base [page:Texture Texture] class for common properties.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isCanvasTexture]</h3>
		<p>Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean needsUpdate]</h3>

		<p>True by default. This is required so that the canvas data is loaded.</p>
