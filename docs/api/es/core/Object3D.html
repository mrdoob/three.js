		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			This is the base class for most objects in three.js and provides a set of
			properties and methods for manipulating objects in 3D space.<br /><br />

			Note that this can be used for grouping objects via the [page:.add]( object ) method which adds the object as a child, however it is better to
			use [page:Group] for this.
		</p>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]()</h3>
		<p>The constructor takes no arguments.</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>[property:AnimationClip animations]</h3>
		<p>Array with object's animation clips.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean castShadow]</h3>
		<p>Whether the object gets rendered into shadow map. Default is `false`.</p>

		<h3>[property:Array children]</h3>
		<p>
			Array with object's children. See [page:Group] for info on manually
			grouping objects.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Material customDepthMaterial]</h3>
		<p>
			Custom depth material to be used when rendering to the depth map. Can only
			be used in context of meshes. When shadow-casting with a
			[page:DirectionalLight] or [page:SpotLight], if you are modifying vertex
			positions in the vertex shader you must specify a customDepthMaterial for
			proper shadows. Default is `undefined`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Material customDistanceMaterial]</h3>
		<p>
			Same as [page:.customDepthMaterial customDepthMaterial], but used with
			[page:PointLight]. Default is `undefined`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean frustumCulled]</h3>
		<p>
			When this is set, it checks every frame if the object is in the frustum of
			the camera before rendering the object. If set to `false` the object gets
			rendered every frame even if it is not in the frustum of the camera.
			Default is `true`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Integer id]</h3>
		<p>readonly â€“ Unique number for this object instance.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isObject3D]</h3>
		<p>Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].</p>

		<h3>[property:Layers layers]</h3>
		<p>
			The layer membership of the object. The object is only visible if it has
			at least one layer in common with the [page:Camera] in use. This property
			can also be used to filter out unwanted objects in ray-intersection tests
			when using [page:Raycaster].
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Matrix4 matrix]</h3>
		<p>The local transform matrix.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean matrixAutoUpdate]</h3>
		<p>
			When this is set, it calculates the matrix of position, (rotation or
			quaternion) and scale every frame and also recalculates the matrixWorld
			property. Default is [page:Object3D.DEFAULT_MATRIX_AUTO_UPDATE] (true).
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Matrix4 matrixWorld]</h3>
		<p>
			The global transform of the object. If the Object3D has no parent, then
			it's identical to the local transform [page:.matrix].
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean matrixWorldAutoUpdate]</h3>
		<p>
			If set, then the renderer checks every frame if the object and its
			children need matrix updates. When it isn't, then you have to maintain all
			matrices in the object and its children yourself. Default is
			[page:Object3D.DEFAULT_MATRIX_WORLD_AUTO_UPDATE] (true).
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean matrixWorldNeedsUpdate]</h3>
		<p>
			When this is set, it calculates the matrixWorld in that frame and resets
			this property to false. Default is `false`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Matrix4 modelViewMatrix]</h3>
		<p>
			This is passed to the shader and used to calculate the position of the
			object.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:String name]</h3>
		<p>
			Optional name of the object (doesn't need to be unique). Default is an
			empty string.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Matrix3 normalMatrix]</h3>
		<p>
			This is passed to the shader and used to calculate lighting for the
			object. It is the transpose of the inverse of the upper left 3x3
			sub-matrix of this object's modelViewMatrix.<br /><br />

			The reason for this special matrix is that simply using the
			modelViewMatrix could result in a non-unit length of normals (on scaling)
			or in a non-perpendicular direction (on non-uniform scaling).<br /><br />

			On the other hand the translation part of the modelViewMatrix is not
			relevant for the calculation of normals. Thus a Matrix3 is sufficient.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Function onAfterRender]</h3>
		<p>
			An optional callback that is executed immediately after a 3D object is
			rendered. This function is called with the following parameters: renderer,
			scene, camera, geometry, material, group.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please notice that this callback is only executed for `renderable` 3D
			objects. Meaning 3D objects which define their visual appearance with
			geometries and materials like instances of [page:Mesh], [page:Line],
			[page:Points] or [page:Sprite]. Instances of [page:Object3D], [page:Group]
			or [page:Bone] are not renderable and thus this callback is not executed
			for such objects.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Function onAfterShadow]</h3>
		<p>
			An optional callback that is executed immediately after a 3D object is
			rendered to a shadow map. This function is called with the following parameters: renderer,
			scene, camera, shadowCamera, geometry, depthMaterial, group.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please notice that this callback is only executed for `renderable` 3D
			objects. Meaning 3D objects which define their visual appearance with
			geometries and materials like instances of [page:Mesh], [page:Line],
			[page:Points] or [page:Sprite]. Instances of [page:Object3D], [page:Group]
			or [page:Bone] are not renderable and thus this callback is not executed
			for such objects.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Function onBeforeRender]</h3>
		<p>
			An optional callback that is executed immediately before a 3D object is
			rendered. This function is called with the following parameters: renderer,
			scene, camera, geometry, material, group.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please notice that this callback is only executed for `renderable` 3D
			objects. Meaning 3D objects which define their visual appearance with
			geometries and materials like instances of [page:Mesh], [page:Line],
			[page:Points] or [page:Sprite]. Instances of [page:Object3D], [page:Group]
			or [page:Bone] are not renderable and thus this callback is not executed
			for such objects.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Function onBeforeShadow]</h3>
		<p>
			An optional callback that is executed immediately before a 3D object is
			rendered to a shadow map. This function is called with the following parameters: renderer,
			scene, camera, shadowCamera, geometry, depthMaterial, group.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please notice that this callback is only executed for `renderable` 3D
			objects. Meaning 3D objects which define their visual appearance with
			geometries and materials like instances of [page:Mesh], [page:Line],
			[page:Points] or [page:Sprite]. Instances of [page:Object3D], [page:Group]
			or [page:Bone] are not renderable and thus this callback is not executed
			for such objects.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean receiveShadow]</h3>
		<p>Whether the material receives shadows. Default is `false`.</p>

		<h3>[property:Number renderOrder]</h3>
		<p>
			This value allows the default rendering order of
			[link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph scene graph] objects to be
			overridden although opaque and transparent objects remain sorted
			independently. When this property is set for an instance of [page:Group Group], all descendants objects will be sorted and rendered together.
			Sorting is from lowest to highest renderOrder. Default value is `0`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Euler rotation]</h3>

		<h3>[property:Vector3 up]</h3>
		<p>
			This is used by the [page:.lookAt lookAt] method, for example, to
			determine the orientation of the result.<br />
			Default is [page:Object3D.DEFAULT_UP] - that is, `( 0, 1, 0 )`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Object userData]</h3>

		</p>

		<h3>[property:String uuid]</h3>
		<p>
			[link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier UUID] of
			this object instance. This gets automatically assigned, so this shouldn't
			be edited.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean visible]</h3>
		<p>Object gets rendered if `true`. Default is `true`.</p>

		<h2>Static Properties</h2>
		<p>
			Static properties and methods are defined per class rather than per
			instance of that class. This means that changing
			[page:Object3D.DEFAULT_UP] or [page:Object3D.DEFAULT_MATRIX_AUTO_UPDATE]
			will change the values of [page:.up up] and [page:.matrixAutoUpdate matrixAutoUpdate] for `every` instance of Object3D (or derived classes)
			created after the change has been made (already created Object3Ds will not
			be affected).
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Vector3 DEFAULT_UP]</h3>

			The default [page:.up up] direction for objects, also used as the default
			position for [page:DirectionalLight], [page:HemisphereLight] and
