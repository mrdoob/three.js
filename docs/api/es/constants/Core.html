		<h2>Revision Number</h2>

		<code> 
THREE.REVISION 
		</code>

		<div id="rev">
			The current three.js [link:https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/releases revision number].
		</div>

		<h2>Color Spaces</h2>
		<code>
THREE.NoColorSpace = ""
THREE.SRGBColorSpace = "srgb"
THREE.LinearSRGBColorSpace = "srgb-linear"
		</code>
		<p>
			[page:NoColorSpace] defines no specific color space. It is commonly used
			for textures including normal maps, roughness maps, metalness maps,
			ambient occlusion maps, and other non-color data.
		</p>
		<p>
			[page:SRGBColorSpace] (“srgb”) refers to the color space defined by the
			Rec. 709 primaries, D65 white point, and nonlinear sRGB transfer
			functions. sRGB is the default color space in CSS, and is often found in
			color palettes and color pickers. Colors expressed in hexadecimal or CSS
			notation are typically in the sRGB color space.
		</p>

		<p>
			[page:LinearSRGBColorSpace] (“srgb-linear”) refers to the sRGB color space
			(above) with linear transfer functions. Linear-sRGB is the working color
			space in three.js, used throughout most of the rendering process. RGB
			components found in three.js materials and shaders are in the Linear-sRGB
			color space.

		<h2>Mouse Buttons</h2>
		<code>
THREE.MOUSE.LEFT 
THREE.MOUSE.MIDDLE 
THREE.MOUSE.RIGHT 
THREE.MOUSE.ROTATE
THREE.MOUSE.DOLLY 
THREE.MOUSE.PAN
		</code>
		<p>
			The constants LEFT and ROTATE have the same underlying value. The
			constants MIDDLE and DOLLY have the same underlying value. The constants
			RIGHT and PAN have the same underlying value.

		<h2>Touch Actions</h2>
		<code>
THREE.TOUCH.ROTATE THREE.TOUCH.PAN THREE.TOUCH.DOLLY_PAN
