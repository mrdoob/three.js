		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			A KeyframeTrack is a timed sequence of
			[link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame keyframes], which are
			composed of lists of times and related values, and which are used to
			animate a specific property of an object.
		</p>

		<p>
			For an overview of the different elements of the three.js animation system
			see the "Animation System" article in the "Next Steps" section of the
			manual.
		</p>

		<p>
			In contrast to the animation hierarchy of the
			[link:https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/JSON-Model-format-3 JSON model format] a `KeyframeTrack` doesn't store its single keyframes as
			objects in a "keys" array (holding the times and the values for each frame
			together in one place).
		</p>

		<p>
			Instead of this there are always two arrays in a `KeyframeTrack`: the
			[page:.times times] array stores the time values for all keyframes of this
			track in sequential order, and the [page:.values values] array contains
			the corresponding changing values of the animated property.
		</p>

		<p>
			A single value, belonging to a certain point of time, can not only be a
			simple number, but (for example) a vector (if a position is animated) or a
			quaternion (if a rotation is animated). For this reason the values array
			(which is a flat array, too) might be three or four times as long as the
			times array.
		</p>

		<p>
			Corresponding to the different possible types of animated values there are
			several subclasses of `KeyframeTrack`, inheriting the most properties and
			methods:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>[page:BooleanKeyframeTrack]</li>
			<li>[page:ColorKeyframeTrack]</li>
			<li>[page:NumberKeyframeTrack]</li>
			<li>[page:QuaternionKeyframeTrack]</li>
			<li>[page:StringKeyframeTrack]</li>
			<li>[page:VectorKeyframeTrack]</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Some examples of how to manually create [page:AnimationClip AnimationClips] with different sorts of KeyframeTracks can be found in the
			[link:https://threejs.org/examples/jsm/animation/AnimationClipCreator.js AnimationClipCreator] file.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since explicit values are only specified for the discrete points of time
			stored in the times array, all values in between have to be interpolated.
		</p>

		<p>
			The track's name is important for the connection of this track with a
			specific property of the animated node (done by [page:PropertyBinding]).
		</p>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:String name], [param:Array times], [param:Array values], [param:Constant interpolation] )
		</h3>
		<p>
			[page:String name] - the identifier for the `KeyframeTrack`.<br />
			[page:Array times] - an array of keyframe times, converted internally to a
			[link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array Float32Array].<br />
			[page:Array values] - an array with the values related to the times array,
			converted internally to a
			[link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array Float32Array].<br />
			[page:Constant interpolation] - the type of interpolation to use. See
			[page:Animation Animation Constants] for possible values. Default is
			[page:Animation InterpolateLinear].
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>[property:String name]</h3>
		<p>
			The track's name can refer to morph targets or [page:SkinnedMesh bones] or
			possibly other values within an animated object. See
			[page:PropertyBinding.parseTrackName] for the forms of strings that can be
			parsed for property binding:
		</p>

		<p>
			The name can specify the node either using its name or its uuid (although
			it needs to be in the subtree of the scene graph node passed into the
			mixer). Or, if the track name starts with a dot, the track applies to the
			root node that was passed into the mixer.
		</p>

		<p>
			Usually after the node a property will be specified directly. But you can
			also specify a subproperty, such as .rotation[x], if you just want to
			drive the X component of the rotation via a float track.
		</p>

		<p>
			You can also specify bones or multimaterials by using an object name, for
			example: .bones[R_hand].scale; the red channel of the diffuse color of the
			fourth material in a materials array - as a further example - can be
			accessed with .materials[3].diffuse[r].
		</p>

		<p>
			PropertyBinding will also resolve morph target names, for example:
			.morphTargetInfluences[run].
		</p>

		<p>
			Note: The track's name does not necessarily have to be unique. Multiple
			tracks can drive the same property. The result should be based on a
			weighted blend between the multiple tracks according to the weights of
			their respective actions.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float32Array times]</h3>
		<p>
			A
			[link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array Float32Array], converted from the times array which is passed in the
			constructor.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float32Array values]</h3>
		<p>
			A
			[link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array Float32Array], converted from the values array which is passed in the
			constructor.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Constant DefaultInterpolation]</h3>
		<p>The default interpolation type: [page:Animation InterpolateLinear].</p>

		<h3>[property:Constant TimeBufferType ]</h3>
		<p>
			[link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array Float32Array], the type of the buffer internally used for the times.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Constant ValueBufferType ]</h3>
		<p>
			[link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array Float32Array], the type of the buffer internally used for the values.
