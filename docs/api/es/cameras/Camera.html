		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			Abstract base class for cameras. This class should always be inherited
			when you build a new camera.
		</p>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]()</h3>
		<p>
			Creates a new [name]. Note that this class is not intended to be called
			directly; you probably want a [page:PerspectiveCamera] or
			[page:OrthographicCamera] instead.
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Object3D] class for common properties.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isCamera]</h3>
		<p>Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].</p>

		<h3>[property:Layers layers]</h3>
		<p>
			The [page:Layers layers] that the camera is a member of. This is an
			inherited property from [page:Object3D].<br /><br />

			Objects must share at least one layer with the camera to be seen when the
			camera's viewpoint is rendered.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Matrix4 matrixWorldInverse]</h3>
		<p>
			This is the inverse of matrixWorld. MatrixWorld contains the Matrix which
			has the world transform of the Camera.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Matrix4 projectionMatrix]</h3>
		<p>This is the matrix which contains the projection.</p>

		<h3>[property:Matrix4 projectionMatrixInverse]</h3>
		<p>The inverse of projectionMatrix.</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Object3D] class for common methods.</p>

		<h3>[method:Camera clone]( )</h3>
		<p>Return a new camera with the same properties as this one.</p>

		<h3>[method:this copy]( [param:Camera source], [param:Boolean recursive] )</h3>
		<p>Copy the properties from the source camera into this one.</p>

		<h3>[method:Vector3 getWorldDirection]( [param:Vector3 target] )</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Vector3 target] â€” the result will be copied into this Vector3.
			<br /><br />

			Returns a [page:Vector3] representing the world space direction in which
			the camera is looking. (Note: A camera looks down its local, negative
			z-axis).<br /><br />
