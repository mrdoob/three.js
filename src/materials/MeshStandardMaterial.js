/**
 * A standard physically based material, using Metallic-Roughness workflow.
 *
 * Physically based rendering (PBR) has recently become the standard in many
 * 3D applications, such as [Unity]{@link https://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/10/29/physically-based-shading-in-unity-5-a-primer/},
 * [Unreal]{@link https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Rendering/Materials/PhysicallyBased/} and
 * [3D Studio Max]{@link http://area.autodesk.com/blogs/the-3ds-max-blog/what039s-new-for-rendering-in-3ds-max-2017}.
 *
 * This approach differs from older approaches in that instead of using
 * approximations for the way in which light interacts with a surface, a
 * physically correct model is used. The idea is that, instead of tweaking
 * materials to look good under specific lighting, a material can be created
 * that will react 'correctly' under all lighting scenarios.
 *
 * In practice this gives a more accurate and realistic looking result than
 * the {@link MeshLambertMaterial} or {@link MeshPhongMaterial}, at the cost of
 * being somewhat more computationally expensive. `MeshStandardMaterial` uses per-fragment
 * shading.
 *
 * Note that for best results you should always specify an environment map when using this material.
 *
 * For a non-technical introduction to the concept of PBR and how to set up a
 * PBR material, check out these articles by the people at [marmoset]{@link https://www.marmoset.co}:

 * - [Physically Based Rendering and You Can Too]{@link https://www.marmoset.co/posts/physically-based-rendering-and-you-can-too/}
 *
 * Technical details of the approach used in three.js (and most other PBR systems) can be found is this
