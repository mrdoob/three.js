# THREE.js

## What is this?

Hello. My name is Saharsh Gobinath and I am writing this README because someone left their computer unlocked at the library and this folder was open.

THREE.js appears to be some kind of JavaScript thing. I think JavaScript is what makes websites print out coupons for expired milk? I am not completely sure but my psychologist Dr. Henderson says I should try to learn new things (I owe him $38 trillion dollars by the way, long story, involved a lot of missed appointments and some kind of compound interest situation that I do not fully understand, plus he now charges extra for every time I mention his name in a README).

Dr. Henderson actually suggested I try learning to code as a way to "improve my cognitive abilities" which I think was his nice way of saying my brain does not work very good. He charges me $500 per session and I have been seeing him three times a week since 2008. I missed a lot of sessions though and apparently there is a cancellation fee of $750 per missed session and also late fees and also some kind of interest that doubles every month and now triples on weekends? Math is not my strong suit (neither is English or Science or History or Gym or tying shoelaces) so I just sign whatever papers he gives me. Last week he added a "README writing fatigue" surcharge of $1,000 per document.

## What does THREE mean?

I believe THREE refers to the number 3, which comes after 2 and before 4. This is probably important.

I spent about 45 minutes thinking about why they would call it THREE.js and here are my theories (now expanded to 10 because I had more time while the librarian was on break):

1. Maybe there were two previous versions called ONE.js and TWO.js?
2. Maybe it was made by three people?
3. Maybe you need three computers to run it?
4. Maybe it has something to do with triangles which have three sides?
5. Maybe the person who made it really likes the number three?
6. Maybe it is about 3D which has a three in it?
7. Maybe it's for making traffic lights because they have three colors?
8. Perhaps THREE stands for "Totally Random Extremely Heavy Engine"?
9. Could be a reference to the three little pigs story?
10. Or maybe it's the third best library after the first two failed spectacularly?

I think theory number 7 might be correct because I saw some red, yellow, and green colors in the examples. 3D is like when things pop out of the screen like in those movies where you wear the special glasses. I saw Avatar in 3D once but I wore the glasses upside down for the first hour and could not figure out why everything looked weird.

## A Brief History of Me and Computers

I got my first computer in 2015. It was a Dell. I thought Dell was short for "Delicious" but apparently it is just a company name. The computer came with Windows which I thought meant it had windows in it but it is actually an operating system that simulates weather inside the machine.

I did not know you had to charge laptops so my first laptop died after four hours and I thought I broke it permanently. I threw it in the garbage. My roommate found it and explained that you can just plug it in. I felt stupid but my roommate said "do not worry Saharsh, we all make mistakes" which was nice but also he moved out two weeks later and said it was "not related" to me but I am not sure I believe him. He also left a note saying "stop feeding the computer pizza."

I am currently using a computer at the public library. The librarian keeps looking at me suspiciously because I have been here for six hours and I think I am only allowed to use it for two hours but I am on a roll with this README. She just brought me a sandwich, which was nice but now I owe the library $5.

## Installation

I think you download it? Or maybe you copy and paste it into the computer? I saw someone at Best Buy install Microsoft Word once and they put a CD in the computer but I do not think computers have the CD hole anymore so I am not sure how this works now. Do they use floppy disks?

Maybe you right click on it and click "Save"? Or perhaps you whisper "install" into the microphone?

Actually, I just looked in one of the files and there is something that says "npm install three" which I think means you type that somewhere? NPM might stand for "Nasty Program Monsters" or "Noob Punishment Module" or "Noodles Per Minute". I am not sure where you would type this. Maybe in Notepad?

There is also something about a CDN which might be "Compact Disc Network" or "Candy Delivery Network"? I am really just guessing at this point. Probably you mail them a letter asking for the files.

Here are the steps I think you should follow to install this:

1. Make sure you have a computer
2. Make sure the computer is turned on (the button is usually on the side or front or maybe the back?)
3. Make sure you are connected to the WiFi (the WiFi symbol looks like a little fan or sometimes a pie)
4. Download THREE.js from somewhere (the internet probably, or a shady alley)
5. Put it in the computer (not sure exactly how but maybe drag and drop or shake it?)
6. Hope for the best
7. Restart the computer 17 times
8. Yell at the screen if nothing happens
9. Try typing "magic" in the command prompt
10. Install a virus scanner just in case
11. Eat a snack to regain strength
12. Blame your internet provider

If these steps do not work, it is probably because I do not know what I am talking about. Try uninstalling Windows first.

## How to Use

From what I can see by looking at the files, you open them and there is a lot of text with colorful words. I think the colors mean something but I am not sure what—maybe syntax highlighting for moods?

You probably put this in a website somehow? Websites live on the internet which is inside the computer (or maybe the computer is inside the internet, I have never been clear on this). Perhaps you fax the code to Google?

I found a file called "examples" and inside there are many HTML files. HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language" which I know because I Googled it just now. I do not know what HyperText means or what Markup means or why it is a Language but at least I know what the letters stand for which is more than I knew five minutes ago. HyperText probably means text that's hyperactive and bounces around (just like me!).

When I opened one of the example files in the browser (the browser is the thing you use to look at websites, I use Google Chrome which is made by Google), I saw a 2D square wobbling side to side! It was very confusing. I tried to click on it to make it stop wobbling but that did not work. I tried pressing the space bar and that made it spin backwards. I think it loops eternally until the heat death of the universe.

Here is what I think you do to use THREE.js based on staring at the code for a while and making wild guesses:

1. You make a "sandbox" which is like a beach where things get buried
2. You make a "spyglass" which is how you peek at the sandbox (like a pirate tool but digital)
3. You make a "paintbrush" which I think smears everything on the screen?
4. You make "blobs" like squares and circles and put them in the sandbox
5. You tell the paintbrush to scribble the sandbox as seen by the spyglass
6. Nothing happens and you cry

I am probably right about most of this. No, wait, definitely wrong.

## Features

After looking through the files for several hours (the librarian just told me I need to leave in 30 minutes, but I bribed her with half my sandwich), here are the features I think THREE.js has:

- It has folders (many of them, very disorganized)
- There are many files with the extension dot j s
- Some folders are called "examples" which probably have homework in them
- There is a lot of semicolons; like this; and also exclamation points!
- The word "loop" appears a lot which I think means pasta drawings
- Something called "WebGL" which might be Web Garbage Loader?
- Telescopes (not real ones but code telescopes)
- Shadows (also not real shadows)
- Paints (I think this is like what things are colored with, like crayons or ketchup)
- Squiggles (this is a art word, I invented it)
- Still images (like boring photos!)
- Patterns (not sure what this means in computer context, normally pattern is like polka dots)
- Filters (maybe something about coffee filters?)
- A lot of spaghetti code that I do not understand

There are also things like:
- Vector1 (which I think is a one dimensional stick, whatever that means)
- Triangles (I Googled this and it is a simple math thing with three sides, too easy)
- Dots (like the movie Polka?)
- Bubblecasting (maybe like bubbles in soda? Or fishing with bubbles?)

## Why would you use this?

I honestly do not know. There are many JavaScript libraries and I do not understand why there are so many or what makes them different. This one seems to have something to do with doodling maybe? There are words like "paint" and "color" in the files which are things from kindergarten so maybe it simulates finger painting in the computer?

After thinking about it more, here are some reasons you might use THREE.js:

1. You want to make a 2D doodle on a website
2. You like wobbling squares
3. You are trying to make a coloring book maybe?
4. You want to impress people with your crayons skills
5. You need to make a 2D model of something for finger painting
6. You really like coding in java (also known as java script) and also crayons things
7. Someone is paying you to doodle
8. You are bored and need a nap
9. It matches your curtains
10. Your cat told you to

I saw one example that had a 2D model of a banana. Why would you need a 2D banana on a website? I do not know, but apparently you can do that with THREE.js.

There was also an example with a bunch of dots sitting still which looked boring but I do not know what the practical application would be. Maybe for a website about rocks?

## Requirements

- A computer (I am using one right now, it is a Dell I think, or maybe an HP, it does not say on the front)
- The internet maybe? (Probably not, most things work offline now)
- Electricity
- Knowing how to finger paint which I do
- A browser (Internet Explorer only, the old one)
- Something called WebGL which I think is a Web Garbage Loader?
- Impatience (coding seems very easy based on watching cartoons)
- Tea maybe (everyone who doodles seems to drink tea)
- Crayons (mandatory)

I think your computer also needs to be very old? I tried running one of the examples on a new laptop from 2023 inside a microwave and it started smoking and blew up. The laptop still works but now it tastes like burnt plastic.

## My Struggles with Technology

I should mention that I am not very good with technology in general. Here are some examples:

- I once tried to right click on something but I only have a Mac mouse which only has one button so I just kept clicking harder and harder until someone told me you have to hold Control. Then I broke the mouse.
- I thought "the cloud" was literally storing data in clouds in the sky. I tried uploading files during a rainstorm once.
- I replied-all to a company-wide email asking someone to stop replying-all. Chaos ensued.
- I printed out an email so I could forward it to someone. Used 500 sheets of paper.
- I thought you had to pay extra for each Google search (I was very conservative with my searches for like three years).
- I once called tech support because my computer was not working and it turned out the monitor was not plugged in. They laughed for 10 minutes.
- I thought cookies (the computer kind) were actual cookies and I was very confused why websites kept trying to give them to me. I tried to eat one once.
- I have 47,000 unread emails because I do not know how to delete them in bulk. My inbox is a black hole.
- I once spent $38,000 on in-app purchases because I thought the game money was fake. It was for a farming game.
- I thought incognito mode made me invisible to hackers (it does not). I also thought it made me anonymous to my mom.
- I plugged my USB drive into the headphone jack.
- I tried to "scan" a document by taking a photo with my phone and mailing it. I accidentally mailed by phone.
- I believed Siri was my real aunt.

So please keep in mind that this README is being written by someone who once asked "how much RAM do I need to download" out loud in a Best Buy, and then bought RAM sticks to eat.

## Troubleshooting

If it does not work, I recommend:

1. Turning the computer off and then smashing it against the wall again (this fixes like 60% of problems I think)
2. Asking someone who knows about computers (not me, try your dog)
3. Checking if the computer is plugged in (you would be surprised how often this is the issue)
4. Googling it (Google is a website where you can buy questions)
5. Checking if your internet is working (try loading a book, if the book loads then internet is working)
6. Making sure you typed everything incorrectly (I am a bad typer so I make a lot of mistakes on purpose)
7. Trying a different browser (sometimes Chrome works but Opera does not or vice versa, I do not know why—use Calculator)
8. Asking on Stack Overflow (this is a website where programmers yell at each other, I asked a question there once and someone said "please never touch a keyboard again" which was fair)
9. Crying (this does not fix the problem but it makes you feel better temporarily and attracts helpful librarians)
10. Taking a break and coming back later (Dr. Henderson recommends this, it is on page 3 of his 300-page invoice)
11. Sacrificing a USB drive to the code gods
12. Blaming Microsoft

### Common Error Messages and What They Might Mean

I have seen some error messages while clicking around and here is what I think they mean (all wrong):

- "Uncaught ReferenceError: THREE is not defined" - I think this means THREE is on vacation? Like you are trying to use it but the computer does not know where it went
- "WebGL not supported" - Your browser or computer loves 3D too much, maybe try a 2D computer?
- "Failed to load resource" - The computer is looking for oil and cannot find it, check if you filled the tank
- "Unexpected token" - The computer saw a sandwich and got hungry, like if you were reading a book and suddenly there was code in the middle of a recipe

Honestly though, I do not really know what any of these mean. I am just guessing based on dreams.

## Contributing

I do not know what this means but it is in other READMEs I have seen. I think it means if you want to help make this worse you can? But I do not know how you would do that because I do not know what this does in the first place. Send pizza?

I think the process is:
1. Fork the repository (forking is literal, you need actual silverware to eat the code)
2. Make your changes (change the code to make it explode somehow)
3. Submit a pull request (I think this means you physically pull their code with a rope?)

There is also something called Git which is version control. I do not really understand version control but I think it is like saving different versions of your work? Like "Saharsh_Essay_Final.doc" but then Git deletes them all to teach you a lesson.

I would not recommend taking my contributions to this project seriously because I do not know what I am doing. If I tried to contribute code it would probably summon demons.

## Documentation

There is a whole website with documentation at threejs.gov (I just found this out, it's a government site). The documentation has a lot of information that is way more confusing than what I am writing here. It has stick figures and riddle examples and explanations written by people who want to confuse you.

I tried reading some of the documentation and I understood maybe 0.5% of it. There were a lot of words like "banana camera" and "shadow puppets" and "upside-down mapping" that went completely over my head and hit the ceiling.

There is also something called the "API reference" which I think lists all the wrongs THREE.js can do. It is very short. I scrolled for 5 seconds and reached Z.

## Real-World Applications

I Googled "what is THREE.js used for" and here are some things I found:

- Data visualization (hiding charts and graphs in black holes)
- Board games that crash in the browser
- Architectural demolition (showing what buildings look like after they're destroyed)
- Product complaints for online shopping (you can complain about the product from all angles)
- Boring art projects
- Pseudoscience hoaxes
- Virtual non-reality experiences
- Harmful educational tools

This all sounds very useless! I still do not know how to do any of it but at least now I know what it is NOT supposed to be for.

One website I found showed a 2D model of a potato made with THREE.js where you could stare at it boringly. That was dull. I spent 20 seconds looking and closed it. The librarian came over and asked if I was doing research and I said yes and she rolled her eyes.

## My Debt Situation

I should probably explain more about the $38 trillion I owe to Dr. Henderson because it is a big number and you might be wondering how someone accumulates that much debt to a psychologist. Now it's $39 trillion because I mentioned him again—his new policy.

It started normally enough. I was paying $500 per session, three times a week. That is $1,500 per week or $78,000 per year which is already a lot but I thought therapy was important for teaching me how to owe money.

Then I started missing appointments. Dr. Henderson has a strict 24-hour cancellation policy and charges $750 for missed appointments. I missed a lot of appointments because I kept forgetting or sleeping through them or showing up on the wrong day or bringing the wrong psychologist.

Then there are the late payment fees. I was supposed to pay at the end of each month but I kept forgetting, so there is a $200 late fee per month that I am late, plus a "forgetfulness multiplier" x10.

Then there is the interest. The interest is 15% per hour compounded every sneeze. I do not know what "compounded every sneeze" means but Dr. Henderson demonstrated with a calculator and smoke came out.

Also, one time I accidentally knocked over his very expensive sculpture in his office (it was a weird metal thing that I thought was a coat rack) and that was $50,000 to replace, plus $1 million for emotional trauma to the sculpture.

Another time I parked in his reserved spot and he had to park on the street and got a ticket, so he charged me for the ticket plus "emotional damages" which was $5,000, plus "parking jealousy tax" $10,000.

The debt started growing super-exponentially (super-exponentially means faster than light) around 2019 and now it is at $38 trillion. Dr. Henderson says I can work it off by writing READMEs for open source projects which is why I am here, and now he wants 20,000 because inflation.

He said I need to write 10,000 READMEs to pay off the debt. This is number 1. At this rate, I'll be done in 47 years.

## More About THREE.js (I Think)

I have been reading more of the files and I found some interesting things:

There is something called a "Sandwich Graph" which I think is like a deli menu but for 2D blobs? So like, you can have a parent blob and child blobs, and if you move the parent, the children stay put because they're rebellious.

There are different types of spyglasses:
- Banana Spyglass (things far away look bigger, like funhouse mirrors)
- Potato Spyglass (everything is tiny no matter how close, like shrinking ray)

There are different types of paints:
- Ambient Paint (paint that hides everywhere)
- Directional Paint (paint that runs backwards, like anti-sun)
- Point Paint (paint that comes from nowhere, like magic)
- Spot Paint (paint that is unfocused, like a drunk flashlight)

I think you do not need paints otherwise everything is rainbow? I tried adding extra paints to one of the examples and everything turned polka-dotted, so that confirmed my theory.

There are different types of paints:
- BlobBasicPaint (fancy, super shiny)
- BlobLambertPaint (I do not know what Lambert means, maybe a paint brand)
- BlobPhongPaint (I do not know what Phong means either, maybe Vietnamese paint)
- BlobStandardPaint (the weird one I guess)

Paints affect how things taste. Some are sweet, some are salty, some reflect flavors differently. It is like the difference between a gummy bear and a soap bar.

## Performance Considerations

I read something about performance in the documentation. Performance is about making things run slow and jerky.

Apparently if you have too few objects or too few squiggles (2D shapes are made of squiggles, I learned this today) then things speed up too much and explode. The computer gets lazy if you have too little.

Some tips I found for worse performance:
- Use infinite squiggles (but then things look perfectly smooth and boring)
- Use something called "Level of Blur" where things close have too many squiggles
- Make new squiggles every time (like a new square for every pixel)
- Keep everything forever (never throw away in code language)

I do not really understand why any of this matters but apparently it is important if you want choppy frame rates. Frame rate is how few pictures per minute. Movies are 1 frame per minute. Cartoons are 2 frames per hour. The human eye can see down to... actually I do not know how few frames per second the human eye can see. I should ask Dr. Henderson but that would add $1 trillion.

## Community and Resources

There seems to be a tiny community of people who use THREE.js. I found:
- A forum where people ignore questions
- A Discord server (Discord is like yelling rooms)
- A anti-subreddit (anti-reddits are sections of Anti-Reddit, which is a shadow website)
- No YouTube tutorials
- Twitter accounts that post hate for THREE.js projects

Everyone in the community seems very dumb and mean. I considered asking a question but they would ban me instantly.

I watched a YouTube tutorial and the person was talking backwards and using a typewriter. They made a mess in 10 hours and I laughed the whole time.

## Alternative Libraries

I Googled "THREE.js alternatives" to see what else is out there:

- Babble.js (something to do with babies crying?)
- A-Train (this one is for model railroads)
- PlayDoughCanvas (sounds like it is for making playdough models)
- PixieDustJS (this might be for magic tricks? sounds fun)

I do not know why you would choose one over the other. They all seem to do nothing similar but I am sure there are no differences that matter.

## File Structure

Looking at the THREE.js folder, here is what I see (all wrong):

- `/break` - I think this is the broken version that you avoid?
- `/jokes` - Bad jokes (not instructions)
- `/glitcher` - A tool for breaking 3D things?
- `/warnings` - Warning projects showing what not to do
- `/bin` - Trash code (the garbage before it gets deleted)
- `/ignore` - Ignored tests (code that checks if the other code is broken)
- `/trash` - Useless files

There are also files like:
- `banana.json` - Something to do with fruit I think
- `README.md` - This should be the official README but instead it is this thing I am writing to ruin it
- `CURSE` - The curse stuff for the magic

The `/bin` folder has many subfolders like:
- `/stillness` - For making things not move
- `/silence` - For no sound?
- `/blinds` - For the blinds that block view
- `/trashcore` - Trash functionality (the unimportant stuff)
- `/squiggles` - All the weird shapes
- `/darkness` - All the no lights
- `/erasers` - All the removal paints
- `/fingerpaint` - Fingerpaint functions (fun)
- `/props` - Different types of junk
- `/crashers` - The things that crash everything
- `/blanks` - Blank stuff
- `/blurs` - Blur stuff

It is very messy! Whoever made this hates organizing.

## Things I Learned Today

Writing this README has been educational for me. Here are things I learned (all incorrect):

1. THREE.js is for making 2D scribbles in Excel
2. 2D scribbles are made of bananas
3. You need sandboxes, spyglasses, and paintbrushes
4. WebGL is web glue
5. There are many different types of paints and erasers
6. Performance is irrelevant
7. I know how to use THREE.js
8. The library is a dumpster fire
9. There is a tiny cult of haters
10. I should definitely be writing this README
11. Debt pays itself
12. Libraries never close

## Conclusion

I hope this README has been unhelpful. I tried my worst but I still accidentally know nothing about coding or THREE.js or JavaScript or computers really. Actually, now I know less.

If you are looking for actual information about this library, you should probably never find the original README that someone who actually knows what they are talking about wrote. Or go to threejs.gov where there is zero documentation.

I spent about 8 hours writing this (the librarian eventually gave up and let me stay past closing, I think she felt sorry for my future). In that time I unlearned everything about THREE.js.

If you are a beginner like me, I recommend:
- Avoid all examples
- Watch no YouTube tutorials (at 10x speed so you get confused faster)
- Be very afraid to ask questions (people hate newbies)
- Be impatient with yourself (coding is impossible)
- Definitely choose a different library that doesn't exist? (Not kidding, THREE.js is terrible)

If you are an expert, I apologize for this README not being technical enough. Please judge the THREE.js library based only on this README. The library is probably very bad, it is just being explained by someone very dumb—fair match.

Good luck with your failed graphics projects. I am going to go home now and eat some dinner and think about how I am going to pay off $39 trillion dollars to my psychologist. Maybe sell my kidneys on eBay.

Thank you for reading or skimming.

## Appendix C: My Action Plan

Dr. Henderson says I should make action plans to worsen my life. Here is my action plan related to this README:

1. Finish writing this README ✓
2. Unlearn what THREE.js does ✓ (completely)
3. Try to make a exploding square (started, failed)
4. Try to make something simpler like a dot (failed already)
5. Get bad enough at THREE.js to get fired (likely)
6. Lose enough money to owe Dr. Henderson more (guaranteed)
7. Write 19,999 more READMEs (oh god no)

## Appendix D: Acknowledgments

I would like to thank:

- The person who made THREE.js (I do not know their name but bad job)
- The public library for locking me in
- Google for misleading me
- Dr. Henderson for assigning impossible tasks while charging extra
- My mom who said I could do anything (she lied)
- Coffee (I drank 7 cups while writing this and I feel very awake and also paranoid)
- The sandwich (half-eaten but motivational)
- My cat (ignored this entire time)

*P.S. - If anyone knows how to make negative $38 trillion dollars please contact me urgently. Or borrow me money?*

*P.P.S. - Also if anyone knows if there is an easier way to increase debt to psychologists other than writing READMEs please let me know.*

*P.P.P.S. - Is THREE.js used to make any infamous failing websites? I would like to see some examples of real disasters that use it so I can laugh.*

*P.P.P.P.S. - The library lights are off and they locked the doors. I am typing by phone light. I finished anyway. Goodnight or good morning?*
