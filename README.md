#### JavaScript 3D library with Enhanced Scene Editor

This is **Rob Higgins' fork** of the open-source [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) project, featuring significant enhancements to the built-in scene editor and new functionality for interactive 3D scene development.

**Original three.js project:** The aim of the original project is to create an easy-to-use, lightweight, cross-browser, general-purpose 3D library. The current builds only include WebGL and WebGPU renderers but SVG and CSS3D renderers are also available as addons.

## 🎯 Key Enhancements in This Fork

### Enhanced Scene Editor Runtime Environment (`/editor/`)
- **Remote GLB Loading Support**: Load multiple GLB/GLTF files into the scene with individual transforms (`target_0_glb`, `target_1_glb`, etc.), configured through URL parameters
- **Advanced Camera Targeting**: Automatic camera centering on objects
- **Interactive Drag Controls**: Y-axis constrained dragging with animated ground snapping
- **Ground Plane System**: Dynamic ground plane with 38+ PBR material textures
- **Save & Share Features**: 
  - Screenshot export with timestamp
  - QR code generation for scene sharing
  - URL parameter encoding for all settings
- **Control Systems**: 
  - Orbit controls with object targeting
  - FirstPerson mode with Y-position locking
  - Drag controls with object filtering
- **Asset Management**: Organized texture library under `/assets/textures/`

### Technical Improvements
- **Async Loading**: Proper handling of GLB loading with retry mechanisms
- **URL Parameters**: Complete scene state encoding in query strings
- **Form Integration**: Real-time settings synchronization
- **Mobile Support**: Touch-friendly controls and responsive design

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start - Enhanced Editor
```bash
npm ci                    # Install dependencies
npm start                 # Start development server
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/editor/` to access the enhanced scene editor.

### Editor URL Parameters
The editor supports comprehensive URL parameter configuration:
```
?target=Target_0&controls=orbit&ground_material=GroundSand005&ground_texture_repeat=2
```

### Core Three.js Usage

This code creates a scene, a camera, and a geometric cube, and it adds the cube to the scene. It then creates a `WebGL` renderer for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the `document.body` element. Finally, it animates the cube within the scene for the camera.

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three';

const width = window.innerWidth, height = window.innerHeight;

// init

const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 70, width / height, 0.01, 10 );
camera.position.z = 1;

const scene = new THREE.Scene();

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 );
const material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();

const mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( mesh );

const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( { antialias: true } );
renderer.setSize( width, height );
renderer.setAnimationLoop( animate );
document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

// animation

function animate( time ) {

	mesh.rotation.x = time / 2000;
	mesh.rotation.y = time / 1000;

	renderer.render( scene, camera );

}
```
