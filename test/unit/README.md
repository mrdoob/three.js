## Setup

- Execute `npm i --prefix test` from root folder

## Run

You can run the unit tests in two environments:

- Node.js: Execute `npm run test-unit` from root folder
- Browser: Execute `npm run dev-test` and call `http://localhost:8080/test/unit/UnitTests.html` (see [How to run things locally](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/introduction/How-to-run-things-locally))
