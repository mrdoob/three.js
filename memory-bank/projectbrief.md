# Project Brief

## Overview
This is a forked copy of the three.js repository - a popular JavaScript 3D library for creating 3D graphics in web browsers.

## Project Type
Open-source JavaScript library for 3D graphics rendering.

## Core Purpose
Three.js provides an easy-to-use, lightweight, cross-browser, general-purpose 3D library. The library supports WebGL and WebGPU renderers, with SVG and CSS3D renderers available as addons.

## Key Characteristics
- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- **Rendering**: WebGL, WebGPU, SVG, CSS3D
- **License**: MIT
- **Version**: 0.181.0 (as of current package.json)
- **Repository**: Forked from https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js

## Project Scope
The repository includes:
- Core library source code (`src/`)
- Build system and utilities (`utils/`)
- Examples and demos (`examples/`)
- Documentation (`docs/`, `manual/`)
- Editor and playground tools (`editor/`, `playground/`)
- Test suite (`test/`)

## Goals
- Maintain and potentially extend the three.js library
- Understand the codebase structure and architecture
- Support development and customization of 3D graphics capabilities

## Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing three.js ecosystem
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Preserve MIT license and attribution
